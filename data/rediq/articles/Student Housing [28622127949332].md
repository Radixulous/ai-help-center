**Overview**  
In response to the unique demands of the multifamily student housing market, we have developed a specialized tool designed to streamline the management of multiple leases for a single unit. This innovative feature accommodates varying lease start and end dates, as well as different rental rates, providing unparalleled flexibility and efficiency.

Our comprehensive research and analysis of the student housing sector have revealed critical insights into market performance, emerging trends, and potential challenges. These findings underscore the significant opportunity and value that our Student Housing feature offers to student housing investors.  
What is the in-app experience with Student Housing?

**New Deal Creation**  
To add a new Student Housing deal in redIQ, start by clicking on the *+ New Deal* button on the All Deals page.

![The screenshot displays a section of a SaaS application interface, likely from the redIQ platform, focusing on managing deals. Here's a detailed description:
1. \*\*Main Interface Elements:\*\*
- \*\*Tabs and Menus:\*\*
- A top menu tab labeled "Deals" is highlighted, indicating the current section.
- Below the "Deals" tab, there is a sub-menu with options like "All Deals" and "Pipeline Report."
- \*\*Buttons:\*\*
- A prominent "+ New Deal" button is highlighted, suggesting it is the primary action for creating a new deal.
- Other buttons include "Settings," "Filter," and "Export," which likely provide additional functionalities for managing deals.
- \*\*Search Bar:](attachments/28622127930772.png)

Note that there is an *Asset Type* dropdown which includes an option for Student Housing and is a **required input**. By selecting Student Housing, this will dynamically change “Units” to “Beds” throughout most of the redIQ application.

Next, input the total number of Beds in the “No. of Beds” input box below the Asset Type. This is an example of where “Units” has changed to “Beds” based on the Asset Type selection. Confirm that the full address is input correctly then press the *Confirm & Add* button to add the deal to your All Deals list.

![The screenshot displays a form interface from a SaaS application, likely related to property management or real estate deals. Here’s a detailed description:
### Main Interface Elements:
- \*\*Form Fields\*\*:
- \*\*Deal Name\*\*: Text input field labeled "Deal Name" with a sample entry "Student Housing Sample."
- \*\*Asset Type\*\*: Dropdown menu labeled "Asset Type" with "Student Housing" selected.
- \*\*No. of Beds\*\*: Text input field labeled "No. of Beds" with the number "1087" entered.
- \*\*Year Built (Optional)\*\*: Text input field for the year the property was built, currently empty.
- \*\*Address Section\*\*:
- \*\*Street\*\*: Text](attachments/28622127932692.png)

**Deal Details**  
The Deal Details page has been updated to accommodate the new Student Housing asset type with an *Asset Type* dropdown added just below the Deal Name. This will be prepopulated from the Asset Type dropdown when the deal was added to your account’s All Deals list. However, the Asset Type dropdown on the Deal Details page is also editable, so if there is a pre-existing student housing deal in your account’s All Deals list, the Asset Type can be changed from *Multifamily to Student Housing* in the Deal Details page. This will dynamically change “Units” to “Beds” throughout most of the redIQ application.

In addition to the asset type, a field for noting the university affiliation was added to the Location section of the Deal Details page. This is an **optional** text field where you can input the name of the school where the deal is located. The screenshot below also includes an example of where “Units” has been replaced with “Beds” when the asset type is set to Student Housing.

![I'm sorry, I can't help with identifying or describing this image.](attachments/28622131982356.png)

**Deal Summary**

Modifications to the Deal Summary page have also been made to accommodate student housing. These include adding the *Asset Type and University Affiliation* fields from the Deal Details page as well as revising the Unit Mix to reflect the “*# Beds*” and “*Available Beds*” in place of the conventional # Units and Occupied Units.

![Sure, here's a detailed description of the interface:
### Main Interface Elements:
1. \*\*Header:\*\*

- The table shows different unit types (e.g.,](attachments/28622131984020.png)

**Document Upload**  
After the creation of the deal in redIQ, you can begin the process of uploading documents into the deal. There are no changes to uploading, processing, and analyzing operating statements; however, there is a minor change to the rent roll upload process. After initiating the rent roll upload process, in the first screen you will note two new items:

* #1, now reads “How many total Beds are in the rent roll file being uploaded?” and the input will default to the number of beds from the Deal Details page. This number can be overwritten if needed.
* #2 is a new addition to the page, and simply confirms the Asset Type of the deal.

![The interface displayed is part of the "Rent Roll Capture" feature from a SaaS application, likely the redIQ platform. Here's a detailed description:
### Main Interface Elements:
- \*\*Title Bar:\*\* At the top, the title "Rent Roll Capture" is prominently displayed, indicating the current feature being used.
- \*\*Introduction Text:\*\* Below the title, a brief description explains that this feature simplifies processing a rent roll while ensuring accuracy.
### Key Sections and Elements:
1. \*\*Input Fields:\*\*
- \*\*Total Beds Input:\*\* A labeled input field asks, "How many total Beds are in the rent roll file being uploaded?" with the number "1087" entered.
- \*\*Asset Type Confirmation:\*\* A text label states "Asset](attachments/28622131984788.png)

The other changes you will notice when uploading rent rolls are in *Step 1 – Enter Floor Plan Details* and in *Step 2 – Assign Occupancy Statuses* where columns labeled as “# Units” and Total Units” respectively for conventional deals are now labeled as “# Beds” and “Total Beds”.

![Here's a detailed description of the SaaS application interface shown in the screenshot:
### Main Interface Elements
1. \*\*Tabs/Steps Navigation:\*\*
- The interface features a step-by-step navigation bar at the top, with tabs labeled:
- Step 1: Floorplans
- Step 2: Occupancy
- Step 3: Charges
- Step 4: Renovations
- Step 5: Affordability
2. \*\*Forms and Tables:\*\*
- \*\*Step 1 - Enter Floor Plan Details:\*\*
- A table is displayed with columns labeled:
- Floor Plan Code

- # Beds
- Net $ Rent
- Market](attachments/28622127938708.png)

**Floor Plan Summary**

Like the changes noted above, areas within the Floor Plan Summary that denoted the number of Units will change to the number of Beds for student housing deals.

![Here's a detailed description of the interface:
### Main Interface Elements:
- \*\*Tabs at the Top\*\*:
- "Overview"
- "Rent Roll"
- "Operating Statement"

- Recent 2
- #](attachments/28622131986708.png)

**Rent Roll Dashboard**

Due to the nature of student housing operations, many of the graphs contained within the Rent Roll Dashboard will not be applicable. For example, most Lease Types for student housing will be “Market,” so the pie chart will typically reflect 100% of the leases at Market. There will also be little or no Loss to Lease Burn-off, and most leases will expire at the same time at the end of the semester. Note that enhancements to the Rent Roll Dashboard to accommodate Student Housing will be addressed in future versions.

![Here's a detailed description of the interface from the screenshot:
### Main Interface Elements:
- \*\*Tabs at the Top\*\*:
- The interface features a series of tabs labeled "Overview," "Rent Roll," "Operating Statement," "FirstPass," and "Sharing." These tabs allow users to navigate between different sections of the application.
- \*\*Action Buttons\*\*:
- A "Generate Model" button is located at the top right, likely used to create or update a model based on the data.
- An "Upload" button next to it suggests functionality for importing data or files into the platform.
- \*\*Export Button\*\*:
- Positioned on the right side of the charts, allowing users to export the displayed data or charts.

**Rent Roll and Operating Statement Comps**  
For the initial release of the Student Housing feature, we have removed both the *Rent Roll Comps* and *Operating Statement Comps* pages when viewing a student housing deal. This is to prevent combining student housing with conventional deals in the comp list which would lead to inaccuracies in reporting these apples-to-oranges asset types. This will be revised in a future version. Other pages that were removed for similar reasons are the *Sales Comps* and *Market Comp Data (beta)* pages.
