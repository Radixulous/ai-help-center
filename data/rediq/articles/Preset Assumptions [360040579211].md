Preset Assumptions allows redIQ valuationIQ users to save sets of assumptions that they commonly use when underwriting deals.  To get started building assumptions sets, open the menu with your name on the right side of the top toolbar in redIQ and click "Manage Assumptions."

After a set of assumptions has been saved, a user has the option of choosing that assumption set when they are generating a model.  The assumptions will be prepopulated in the Excel model file when it is generated.

Assumptions sets are common across an account, so if anyone creates an assumptions set, any other user of the account will be able to use it when generating a model.  Any other user may also copy or edit an assumptions set.

This functionality is intended to give users a jump start on their underwriting, so if a model has been synced back to redIQ, users will not be able to choose a preset assumptions set when subsequently generating a model.  Instead, the model will be generated with the synced back assumptions.
