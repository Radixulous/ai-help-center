The rent roll up feature allows users to combine rent rolls already in redIQ into one consolidated rent roll. This will help users who are looking to consolidate multiple properties or phases into a single deal.

 In the **Comps** screen, select the **Rent Roll**tab. You can select the deals you would like to Roll Up.
