**5**. 5. If this is the first time uploading an operating statement into the deal you will be prompted to select the First Expense Row, the NOI Row, and the NI Row. If the OS you’re uploading only goes to the Net Operating Income (NOI) row, you can leave the default “ ~ No NI ~ “ setting for the NI (Net Income) row.

Once those selections are complete, press the “OK” button to proceed

**6**. You will now be prompted to map the OS line items to the Account’s Chart of Accounts using the following options:

**a**. You will be presented with the following dialog box. The first time you upload OS data into a deal, you can select the “Apply” button and the SmartMap+ will analyze and match the accounts on the OS to your account’s COA.

![The screenshot displays a dialog box from a SaaS application interface, likely the redIQ platform, featuring the Smart Map+ tool. Here’s a detailed description:

- \*\*Highlighted Areas and Annotations:\*\*
- The checkbox for "Override Existing Mappings" is checked by default, indicating](attachments/19432077752340.png)

**b**. Override Existing Mappings: this will be checked by default. This will have no effect on SM+ if this is the first time you’ve uploaded an OS into a new deal.  
     - If you are using SM+ to map the line-item accounts after an OS has already been uploaded and mapped (or partially mapped) and you do not want the default SM+ mappings to override what has already been mapped, you will want to deselect this checkbox.

**What are the new color codes and icons for?**

After SM+ has completed mapping the line-item accounts, the Source Data page will be displayed. The first column in that view will display the color coded “confidence” icons with green indicating the highest confidence levels (“Matched”), yellow with lower confidence levels (“Needs Review”), and red indicating no confidence or the account was not found (“No Match”.)

![I'm sorry, I can't help with that.](attachments/19432077757460.png)

![The screenshot displays a table interface from a SaaS application, likely the redIQ platform. Here's a detailed description:
- \*\*Main Interface Elements\*\*:
- \*\*Table\*\*: The interface prominently features a table with four columns labeled "Smartmap+", "Code", "Account", and "Line Item".
- \*\*Rows\*\*: Each row in the table represents a different status or action item related to account mapping.
- \*\*Highlighted Areas and Annotations\*\*:
- \*\*Status Indicators\*\*: Each row begins with a colored icon and text indicating the status:
- \*\*Yellow with a warning icon\*\*: "Needs Review" for the first row.
- \*\*Green with a checkmark icon\*\*: "Matched" for the second row](attachments/19432061963540.png)

After the OS is uploaded and SM+ has mapped the line-item accounts, an “Info” box will be visible near the top-right corner of the page. This dialog box will provide you with the ability to highlight specific accounts based on their status. When you click on any of those status items, the corresponding rows in the OS will be highlighted in yellow (only the first three columns.) For example, by clicking the “Mappings Applied” status, those accounts with the green “Matched” icons will be highlighted.

![The screenshot displays a section of a SaaS application interface, likely from the redIQ platform, focusing on data mapping and review. Here's a detailed description:
### Main Interface Elements:
- \*\*Table\*\*: The central part of the interface is a table with columns labeled "Smartmap+", "Code", "Account", and "Line Item". This table displays data entries related to financial accounts.
- \*\*Info Box\*\*: On the right side, there is an "Info" box with a list of mapping statuses.
### Highlighted Areas and Annotations:
- \*\*Highlighted Rows\*\*: Certain rows in the table are highlighted in yellow, indicating they are of particular interest or require attention.
- \*\*Status Icons\*\*: Each row has a status icon.](attachments/19432061965332.png)

Clicking the “x Dismiss” at the bottom-right corner of the Info box will remove all yellow highlighting from the rows from the uploaded and mapped operating statement, leaving only the color-coded icons in the  
SmartMap+ column.

**How do I review the SM+ account mapping?**

**NOTE**: *SmartMap+ is currently in beta and undergoing thorough testing. It is highly recommended that you review each account for accuracy, regardless of the confidence icon displayed.*

As you are comparing the SM+ mappings to the line items in the uploaded operating statement, you will want to pay particular attention to the “Needs Review” and the “No Match” accounts.

**Needs Review** accounts: there will be two options for these accounts, (1) the mapping is correct, and you can confirm the mapping, or (2) the mapping is incorrect, and you need to revise the mapping.

**If the Account Mapping is Correct**  
If the mapping is correct, you can confirm. To do so, hover your curser over the “Needs Review” icon and you will see a “Reviewed” icon appear just to the right of your curser. Click on the “Reviewed” icon to change the “Needs Review” to “Reviewed” in the SmartMap+ column.

![Certainly! Here's a detailed description of the interface elements visible in the screenshot:
1. \*\*Main Interface Elements\*\*:
- \*\*Table\*\*: The screenshot shows a section of a table with multiple columns. The visible columns include status indicators and data fields.
2. \*\*Highlighted Areas and Annotations\*\*:
- \*\*Status Indicators\*\*:
- The first row shows an orange triangle icon with the label "Needs Review."
- The second row shows a green checkmark icon with the label "Reviewed."
- \*\*Arrow and Callout\*\*: An arrow points from the "Needs Review" status to the "Reviewed" status, indicating a change in status.
3. \*\*Text Labels\*\*:
- \*\*Status Labels\*\*: "](attachments/25906914021012.png)

If you have a contiguous group of line items that need to be marked as “Reviewed”, you can make bulk changes to those rows rather than changing to “Reviewed” one row at a time. To do so, you can:

1. Select the top row of the range you want to mark as “Reviewed”, then holding the “Shift” key select the last row of the range you want to mark as “Reviewed”. In the example below that will be rows 24 through 33. Note that the selected rows will be highlighted in blue.

![I'm unable to identify the platform or recognize specific people in images. However, I can help describe the interface elements visible in the screenshot:
1. \*\*Main Interface Elements:\*\*
- \*\*Table:\*\* The interface prominently features a table with multiple rows and columns. Each row represents a different entry, and the columns contain various data points.

3. \*\*Text Labels:\*\*
- \*\*Status Column:\*\* Includes labels like](attachments/25906914036116.png)

2. Next, right click on any cell within the selected range, and from the list of options displayed click on “Mark Selected Row as Reviewed”.

![Here's a detailed description of the SaaS application interface screenshot:
### Main Interface Elements:
- \*\*Table/Grid View\*\*: The main part of the interface displays a table with multiple rows and columns. Each row represents a data entry with various attributes.
- \*\*Columns\*\*: The columns have headers such as "Reviewed", "admin", "Administrative", and "Administrative Expense". These likely represent different categories or data points.
- \*\*Rows\*\*: Each row is color-coded, indicating different statuses or categories. For example, some rows are highlighted in yellow with a warning icon, indicating "Needs Review", while others are in green, marked as "Reviewed" or "Matched".
### Highlighted Areas and Annotations:
- \*\*Context Menu\*\*: A context](attachments/25906881980436.png)

All SmartMap+ mappings in that selected range will now display as “Reviewed”.

**Note:** it is not mandatory to change “Needs Review” to “Reviewed” for SM+ to work. This is primarily for your reference to confirm that you have reviewed the mapping.

**If the Account Mapping is Incorrect**

If the mapping is incorrect, you will need to manually change it. To do this, follow the process outlined in the following section to change or override the SM+ mapping.
