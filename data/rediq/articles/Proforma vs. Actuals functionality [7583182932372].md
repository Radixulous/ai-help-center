The Proforma vs. Actuals functionality feature relies on support for Below Net Operating Income line items. With it, users can compare Operating Statements uploaded to the system and proforma financial reports, letting you, the user, better understand how a given property could perform in the future.

For our Multi-family users, Proforma will be a key report that will help gather current or estimated income and expense data to project the net operating income and cash flow of a property. redIQ already provides the ability to upload “actual financial reports” using Operating statement within a deal which reports the true financial performance of a rental property. The Proforma feature allows a user to upload up to three proforma financial reports which will help the users to make an informed decision on how a property could, should or would perform over the incremental years.

To upload a Proforma document, it is the same process as you would normally do to upload an Operating Statement by pressing the blue “+Add” button in the top corner. This will present you a drop down to upload the document.

If you would like to change or edit the name of your Proforma document, you can do so in the Deal Details page under the “Proforma Type” section.
