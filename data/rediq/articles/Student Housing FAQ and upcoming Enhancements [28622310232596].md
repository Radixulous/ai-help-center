* Can I change the Asset Type of an existing deal to Student Housing?

  New fields include the Asset Type dropdown and a University Affiliation field where you can input the name of the associated school.

  In the Floor Plan Summary, areas that previously showed the number of Units now display the number of Beds for Student Housing deals.

  Yes, due to the nature of student housing operations, many graphs in the Rent Roll Dashboard may not be applicable or may show limited variation.

  No, operating statement reports and dashboards are not affected by the Student Housing asset type selection.
* Are there any redIQ capabilities that are unavailable for Student Housing deals?  
  The Rent Roll Comps, Operating Statement Comps, Sales Comps, and Market Comp Data (beta) pages are currently unavailable for Student Housing deals. All but the Market Comp Data (beta) pages will be available in a future enhancement.

**Planned upcoming enhancements / features for Student Housing?**

As noted above, this is our initial launch of the Student Housing feature. We are in the process of designing and developing the following enhancements and features for future versions:

* **valuationIQ Enhancements** – changes will be made to the valuationIQ model whereby if Asset Type equals Student Housing, places within the model that currently display the word “Units” will dynamically change to “Beds.” Note that you can generate a student housing model in the current version; however, the terminology within the model has not yet been modified to display “beds” in place of “units” for the Student Housing asset type.
* **Prelease Rent Roll processing** – student housing operators and investors utilize Prelease (Future Resident) rent rolls in addition to the current rent rolls. There are minor formatting differences between current and prelease rent rolls that will need to be addressed, and we will need a mechanism in place to differentiate between the two versions.
* **Deal Accelerator** – the Student Housing asset type will be added to the deal accelerator.
* **Shared Deals** – this functionality will also be applied to student housing deals.
