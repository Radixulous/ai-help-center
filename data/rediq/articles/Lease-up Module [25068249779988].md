For users looking to model lease-up deals, redIQ has created the ***valuationIQ Lease-up Module*** to implement into your model. With redIQâ€™s lease-up module, you can accurately model vacancy on a monthly level until stabilization. Not only does this enable more granularity, using a more realistic leasing velocity can also significantly impact the proforma NOI. Users can utilize this module to help with forecasting the cash flows more accurately and understanding when the property will reach stabilization.

**How to use the Module**  
Users need to download the Module [here](https://bit.ly/3vMsMgp) to start working with the module.
