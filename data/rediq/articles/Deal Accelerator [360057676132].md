### **Overview**

***What is the in-app experience for clients with Deal Accelerator?***

Upon initially logging in, clients will be presented with the opportunity to set up the Deal Accelerator. A client can select to set up their criteria now, later, or dismiss the setup altogether.

![Sure! Here's a detailed description of the interface:

\*\*Main Interface Elements:\*\*
1. \*\*Sidebar Menu:\*\*

### ***Investment Criteria and Notification settings***

The first step after the client selects *Setup Deal Accelerator* is to input their Investment Criteria and Notification settings.

**Investment Criteria:**

Criteria is set for the following mandatory parameters:

* Markets – select by All (Nationwide), State, or Market/MSA
* Year Built – input a minimum and maximum value
* Number of units – input a minimum and maximum value
* Property Type – select Market (Conventional) or Affordable
  + Check the box to include value-add properties *(optional, if applicable)*

![The screenshot displays a settings panel from a SaaS application interface, likely related to real estate investment criteria. Here's a detailed description:
### Main Interface Elements:
- \*\*Settings Panel\*\*: A vertical panel on the left side of the screen.
- \*\*Buttons\*\*:
- "Save Settings" button at the bottom of the panel.
- "Reset to default" links for both Criteria and Notification settings.
### Sections and Inputs:

- \*\*Year Built\*\*:

- Checkbox labeled "](attachments/10070410757396.png)

* The “Year Built” and “Number of units” inputs cannot be left blank; however, if you do not want to limit the results based on those parameters you can input a large range. For example,
  + a minimum of “1” and a maximum of “5000” for the Number of units, and
  + “1900” to “2022” for the Year Built.
    - ***Note:*** *for the Year Built inputs, the minimum year built must be greater than 1899 and the maximum input for the Year Built cannot exceed the current year.*

**Notification Settings:**

The next step is to input your notification settings. A client will be able to receive notifications for deals that match their investment criteria either in-app, by email, or both.

The client must set criteria for the following mandatory parameters:

* redIQ App Notifications – select *As soon as possible, Daily, or Weekly*
  + Selecting “As soon as possible” will provide near-real-time notifications of new Berkadia deals that have been listed that match the client’s investment criteria
* Email Frequency – select *Daily, Weekly, or Never*
* Email Address – input the email address for the notifications

### ***Deal Matching***

After completing the Criteria and Notification settings and clicking the *Save Settings* button, clients will immediately be shown any existing Berkadia deals that match their investment criteria on the Deal Accelerator tab. The deals are shown on individual cards as well as a map view.

![The interface displayed is part of a SaaS application, likely the redIQ platform, specifically on the "Deal Accelerator" tab. Here’s a detailed description:
### Main Interface Elements:

- \*\*The Retreat at Cypress Station](attachments/10070471317524.png)

Alternatively, matching deals will also be displayed using a notification located in the bottom right corner of the screen. This notification is visible on all redIQ tabs and contains property information along with the option for the client to either dismiss or access the deal. If the client chooses to access the deal, the next step is to add the deal to their deal list as outlined below.

![Here's a detailed description of the SaaS application interface:
### Main Interface Elements:

### ***Adding a deal to the account’s deal list***

The next step in the process is to add a deal to the account’s Deal List in redIQ. After clicking on the *Access Deal* button, clients will be presented with the Confidentiality Agreement pop-up for the deal. A client must agree to the terms and conditions and click the *Add and Continue* button to add the deal to their Deal List in redIQ. A PDF copy of the Berkadia Terms and Conditions document will be emailed to the client after clicking on “Add and Continue”. Only one Confidentiality Agreement per Account will need to be executed. After the initial execution, any member of that Account will be able to view the deal.

![Here's a detailed description of the interface:
- \*\*Main Interface Elements:\*\*
- \*\*Title Bar:\*\* At the top, there is a title bar labeled "Terms and Conditions."
- \*\*Close Button:\*\* In the upper right corner, there is an "X" button to close the window.

- \*\*Highlighted Areas and Annotations:\*\*
- \*\*Checkbox:\*\* Near the bottom, there is a checkbox labeled "I agree to terms and conditions." This is highlighted with a red outline, indicating it needs user interaction.
- \*\*Button:\*\* Next to](attachments/10070495727892.png)

When this is completed, the *Access Deal* button will change to a *View Deal* button on the deal card.

1. \*\*Deal Cards\*\*:

- A timestamp ("3 months ago") is displayed in the top-left corner of each card.
- There is a vertical ellipsis (three dots) in the top-right corner, likely indicating additional](attachments/10070513165076.png)

***NOTE****: All deals presented to clients in the Deal Accelerator will match their investment criteria. It’s recommended as a best practice that clients add all deals of interest to their Deal List to build up their comp set.*

Each deal card includes three ellipses at the top-right corner. Clicking on these ellipses will provide you with three shortcuts:

* *Not interested*: clicking this will permanently remove the deal from your Deal Accelerator list
* *Contact [broker name]*: clicking this will open your native email application and prepopulate the recipient email address and Subject line so that you can email the broker
* *Visit Website*: clicking this will open the property’s listing website in your browser

### ***Viewing the new deal***

The deal can now be accessed via the View Deal button on the card, or by accessing the deal from the account’s Deal List. The client will have access to the Rent Rolls, Historicals, Proforma Models, and the Berkadia Doc Center directly from the Overview tab.

### ***What are next steps if clients have an interest in deals post-underwriting in redIQ?***

The Deal Accelerator is designed to help clients screen and underwrite Berkadia listings that match their criteria faster. Once a client has added a deal, they can begin mapping their operating data, make adjustments, and run a QuickSync report or valuationIQ model - the same functionality clients have for their existing deals.

### ***When a redIQ client adds a deal through the Deal Accelerator program, what documents do they have access to?***

They will have access to all documents stored in the Berkadia document center for the listing after they sign the Confidentiality Agreement. This includes Rent Roll and Operating Statement data uploaded by the Berkadia financial analyst.

### **ISSUE RESOLUTION**

***What is recourse for clients who accidently clicked to indicate disinterest but meant to express an interest in a deal?***

Clients will be able to view all deals they have been matched with via the Deal Accelerator page. From that page, they will be able to add deals they are interested in and dismiss deals they would like to permanently remove. If the client did this by mistake or would otherwise like to access a deal they have previously dismissed, please contact your redIQ CSM.

***What is the process for clients to update their acquisition criteria or to opt-out of Deal Accelerator acquisition criteria matching opportunities?***

Clients will have the ability to update their investment criteria and notification settings at any time within the Deal Accelerator page by clicking on the *Manage Investment Criteria* or *Notification Settings* button.
