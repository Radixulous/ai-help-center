ValuationIQ is a valuation model add-on component to our core offering of the online redIQ platform. It is an Excel based model built to underwrite stabilized multifamily residential acquisitions. The standardized underwriting model automatically incorporates operating data loaded to the redIQ platform so all you need to do to get a full underwriting is enter your assumptions.

#### **Compatibility**

The model is compatible with both the Windows and Mac operating systems and Excel versions.

If you're interested in adding the valuation model to your subscription, please contact [sales@rediq.com](mailto:sales@rediq.com).
