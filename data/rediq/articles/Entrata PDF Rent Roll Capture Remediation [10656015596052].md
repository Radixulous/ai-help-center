Please be advised that as of 11/7/2022 at 12:32PM EST, redIQ is temporarily pausing the automatic capture of Entrata PDF rent rolls due to remediate a newly detected issue which may cause some charge codes to improperly capture automatically. The issue is due to a change by Entrata to their output format in some versions of their system. Entrata PDF rent rolls will fail when you try to upload them and should be **submitted to our support team** while we update the capture algorithm.  Submitted Entrata rent rolls will receive high priority processing during this time for quick turnaround.  redIQ's engineers are already working on upgrading the auto-capture system to account for the new data standards and expect to complete testing and deployment later this week.
