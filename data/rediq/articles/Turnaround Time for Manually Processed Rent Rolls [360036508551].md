If a rent roll has been submitted to redIQ Support, we'll make sure the data is loaded onto the platform in a timely manner. Please note that we strive to upload rent rolls as quickly as possible but our guidelines for turnaround time are as follows:

* If we receive the rent roll by 5:00pm Eastern and there are no clarifying questions needed to start processing, then we target completion and upload no later than the morning of the next business day.
* If we receive the rent roll after 5:00pm Eastern, then we target completion and upload by the afternoon of the next business day.
* On some occasions processing can take up to 24 hours, regardless of the time it was received. We will notify you if we require a longer timeframe to complete the request.

#### Please Note

redIQ makes best efforts to turnaround documents in 6 business hours or less.
