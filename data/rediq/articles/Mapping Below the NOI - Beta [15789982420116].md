To map items below the NOI line, click on the Operating Statements tab in the selected deal, then click on the Source Data option. From there, users can scroll to their data below the marked NOI line and map their data below the NOI line just the same as when [mapping items above the NOI line](https://rediq.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043783112-Mapping-Operating-Statements-#mapping-operating-statements-0-0).

When mapping below the NOI line, users must make sure they are using the specific account mappings meant for BNOI line items. If users map the BNOI line items using any other mappings than the BNOI specific mappings, the data will be incorrectly mapped and NOI lines will not match. The specific mappings will only contribute to the designated BNOI rows and if used above the NOI line, the data will be incorrectly mapped.

![The screenshot displays an interface from a SaaS application, likely the redIQ platform, focused on financial data management. Here’s a detailed description of the interface elements and workflow:
### Main Interface Elements:
1. \*\*Navigation Bar:\*\*
- Located at the top, with tabs such as "Deals," "Shared Deals," "Comps," and "Deal Accelerator."
2. \*\*Title and Context:\*\*
- Displays "01248 - Presbyterian Village Athens" indicating the project or property being analyzed.
3. \*\*Sub-navigation Tabs:\*\*
- Includes "Overview," "Rent Roll," "Operating Statement," "FirstPass," and "Sharing."
4. \*\*View and Grouping Options:\*\*

**(*In the example screenshot above, we can see that our BNOI lines (Calculated New Income, Original Net Income, Net Income Variance) match correctly. We can also see the BNOI mappings options listed in the dropdown)***

Listed below are the BNOI specific mapping accounts that are available to users when mapping below the NOI line items. These mappings can be found on your [Chart of Accounts](https://rediq.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360036506651-Chart-of-Accounts) and are able to be edited like the above the NOI mapping options.
