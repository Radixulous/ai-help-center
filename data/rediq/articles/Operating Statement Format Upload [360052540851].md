You can add historicals to redIQ by highlighting the data in excel then copying and pasting it in the **Add Historicals** button .When highlighting the data in excel there are a few formatting rules to follow to ensure a successful upload:

* The first row of your selection must be dates that include both month and year. Dates need to be formatted in specific values ex: **(Nov 2019, 11/2019, 11/19)**
* If there are inconsistencies in the months, a data gap warning will appear when attempting to upload

* The first column of your selection must be the line item names. Make sure all line items are in one column.

**Note**: Merged cells can potentially cause an error or prevent you from highlighting the appropriate section of the spreadsheet. Unmerging all cells before copying the data can prevent errors.

**Note:**Any characters such as **"=,<,>"** could trigger an excel formula that will not be processed correctly and you will receive this error message
