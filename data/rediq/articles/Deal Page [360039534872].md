The default home screen of redIQ is the Deals page. This page can be accessed any time by clicking “Deals” in the top left corner of the screen.

To create a new deal, click “New Deal” in the top right corner of the page. The deals page can be exported to Excel by clicking the “Export” button. To change the view of this page, use the "Settings" and "Filter" buttons.

In the settings tab, deals can be grouped by different fields. The fields on the page can be customized, and the order of the fields can be modified. All fields with a check mark next to it in settings, will appear on the Deals page. The order of these columns can be customized by dragging and dropping each field in the appropriate position.

The filter changes the view of the page; only deals with certain traits will be visible. The applied filters will persist throughout the session.

The  Action Menu for a Deal can be accessed by clicking the![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/5092438955/original/X8Q_GOJSqMomifLt55_HsgAYiyXgGhNyhA?1515184439)button or right clicking anywhere on the row of a Deal.

All the data presented on the Deals page comes from the Deal Details tab of each individual Deal. This data can be changed by clicking "Edit" on the Action Menu.

By holding the Ctrl button on the keyboard, the user can select multiple Deals, and either update the status, or delete Deals in bulk by right clicking within the selection.
