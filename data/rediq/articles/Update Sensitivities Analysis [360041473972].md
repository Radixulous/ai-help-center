The redIQ model sensitivity analysis determines how different values of an independent variable affect a particular dependent variable under a given set of assumptions.

Click **Update Sensitivities** on redIQ ribbon

Or, click on Sensitivity Analysis on the bottom tab. A popup will automatically show asking if the user wants to update the Sensitivity Table.

 The popup can be disabled for future use by un-checking **show reminder popup** in the **other settings** drop down on the reqIQ ribbon

#### Please Note

If the file is not responding or the sensitivity tables are not updating correctly, there could be too many files open in Excel. Running the sensitivity tables in the redIQ model uses a lot of computing power and if there are several other Excel files open it could prevent the file from updating. To fix the issue, save the file, shut down all of Excel, then open only the model to see if it updates correctly. If the issue persists, please contact [support@rediq.com](mailto:support@rediq.com).
