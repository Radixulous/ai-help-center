Mapping refers to the act of adding extra details to the data or allocating data to certain categories.

**Mapping Operating Statements:**

Assigning the line items of an operating statement to the Chart of Accounts, which generates a rolled up cash flow.

**Mapping a Rent Roll:**

Adding data detail to the floor plans or assigning codes to occupancy or charge categories (the five steps you go through to finish uploading a rent roll).
