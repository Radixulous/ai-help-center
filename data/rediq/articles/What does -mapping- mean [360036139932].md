Mapping refers to the act of adding extra details to the data or allocating data to certain categories. Mapping historicals is assigning the line items of an operating statement to the Chart of Accounts, which generates a rolled up cash flow. Mapping rent roll data is adding detail to the floor plans or assigning codes to occupancy or charge categories (the five steps you go through to finish uploading a rent roll).
