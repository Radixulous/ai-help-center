**Overview**

SmartMap+ (“SM+”) is an innovative tool designed to streamline the process of mapping an Operating Statement’s line-item accounts to the Chart of Accounts (“COA”) as set up in the client’s Account Settings. By using an index and scoring process (rules engine), SmartMap+ greatly improve this process for our users. Prior to the release of SM+, users would need to manually map the line-item accounts to their account’s COA the first time an unmapped OS was uploaded. With SM+, that process is now automated.

**What is the in-app experience with SmartMap+?**

The goal of this feature is to provide users the ability to upload an Operating Statement (“OS”, aka Financial Statement or Historical) and have the line-item accounts contained in that OS automatically mapped to their account’s COA. Now users can upload an OS, rely on redIQ to automatically map it in seconds, and move forward with their underwriting process much faster. After the first OS is uploaded in a deal, users can continue to utilize SM+ or they can use Legacy Mapping for future OS uploads.

SmartMap+ is most effective when uploading a new operating statement that is in an unfamiliar format (for example, from a seller that you have not worked with previously.) Once you have uploaded the OS and mapped it using SM+, all subsequent operating statements that are in that same format can be quickly mapped using Legacy Mapping.
