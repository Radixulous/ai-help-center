Clients this feature enabled are able to submit PDF and Scanned Operating Statements to redIQ for manual processing and upload into your account.  This service comprises converting PDF or Scanned documents and then uploading into your deal.  Once this has been completed, we will notify you via the email address associated with your redIQ user.

We will process up to 4 documents per submission.  These files must not be Excel or CSV format, as these may be added via the "Copy and Paste" upload on the Add Historicals modal.

Only Actuals data will be included in the upload, even if Budget or Proforma data is included in the submitted files.  Only columns representing a full month or a full year will be included in the upload.  Any partial year data will not be included.

To access this functionality, simply click "Add Historical" from the Historicals Summary page or from the "Add" button then select the link at the bottom of the modal.  If you do not see the link, please contact your account manager at [support@rediq.com](mailto:support@rediq.com) for access.

This service does not include mapping of operating statements to your standard accounts.  We do encourage users to make use of the Smart Mappings functionality to automatically map your operating statement if it is available.  To use this functionality, simply click "Mappings" on the Source Data page then select "Apply Smart Mappings."
