Net Effective Rent is calculated as all charges mapped to Contractual Rent minus all charges mapped to Recurring Concessions. Net Effective Rent can be shown in graphs on the Rent Roll Dashboard or Floor Plan Summary by changing the In-Place Rent filter in the Report Settings from Contractual to Net Effective.
