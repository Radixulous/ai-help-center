• **What is the value of 2-Way Sync?**  
2-Way sync allows you to easily update timely deal information right from Excel, which strengthens redIQ as a collaborative deal management platform.  
• **What is a use case of 2-Way Sync?**  
2-Way Sync helps acquisition teams manage a shared deal pipeline in the cloud. You can now view calculated return metrics in dataIQ from your underwritten deals in Excel.   
• **What data will be synced back?**  
Fields in the Deal Details section that are selected (checked) will be included as part of the sync.  
• **Will this affect what data will be populated?**  
Populating a model with QuickSync or pulling data down is unaffected by the addition of 2-Way Sync. That said, it is important to note that any data synced back will be the new value for a field when re-populating your Excel model. In other words, any sync-backs will overwrite what may have been previously entered online.   
• **Can I sync back rent rolls or operating statements?**  
No, this functionality is currently limited to deal details fields.  
• **Why am I not seeing the Sync button?**  
2-Way Sync may not be enabled for your account. Contact your Customer Success Manager for more information.
