Multiple floor plans can be combined in Step 1 of the initial data mapping or from the Edit Rent Roll screen. When initially mapping the rent roll data, if two or more floor plans are given the same Floor Plan Name they will be combined. If the data has already been mapped, go to the [Edit Rent Roll screen](https://rediq.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/5000742265-edit-rent-roll-screen) and combine floor plans by changing the Floor Plan mappings.
