Fill in the as of "date of the" rent roll and the rest of the file will appear. Now fill in all data in the corresponding columns. One item that is not apparent is where to enter the rent charge. There is a designated column for market rent, but there is no predetermined column for rent.

All charges, including rent, can be entered in the columns on the right side of the spreadsheet starting with column M. Type "Rent" in row 11 of one of the charge code columns and enter the rent charges of each unit below. Other charges or concessions can also be entered into the charge code columns by following the same steps.
