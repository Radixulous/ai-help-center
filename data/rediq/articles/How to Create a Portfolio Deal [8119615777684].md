There may be instances where users have a portfolio Deal and need to have a few different properties Rent Rolls or Operating Statement files combined into one Deal and this can be done with a few easy steps in redIQ.

To do this, you would start by creating a new deal in redIQ for each property that needs to be included in the intended Portfolio. After creating each new deal and successfully uploading and mapping the rent roll or Operating Statement files needed for each property to be included in the Portfolio, Users would then need to head to the "Comps" section of redIQ to combine the uploaded data. This is done by selecting the "Rent Roll" or "Operating Statement" tab at the top of the table, finding the uploaded rent rolls/operating statements needed to be included in the Portfolio, then select the "Roll Up" (rent rolls) or "Aggregate" (Operating Statements) options.

When selecting the Roll Up or Aggregate option, this will combine the uploaded rent roll data into one complete file, present a view within redIQ of the combined data, and also an option to Export the data to Excel. Once Users have received the exported Excel file, Users can then create a new deal in their account to upload the Portfolio Excel file.

The new Portfolio Deal will now have the combined rent roll data as intended. Users who would like more information regarding the Roll Up and Aggregate processes are encouraged to visit the individual articles listed below.
