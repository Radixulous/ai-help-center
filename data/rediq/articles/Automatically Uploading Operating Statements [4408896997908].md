### **What is the Operating Statement Processor?**

In addition to manual upload options, redIQ’s new Operating Statement Processor enables drag-and-drop functionality like existing Rent Roll Processor.  

* Just upload your file to the processor, wait about 10-20 seconds for the processor to pull out your operating data, and that’s it: now your data is in your redIQ account.
* If your file is unsupported or otherwise unable to process, you will still have the option to submit your file to our manually processing team, which will process your document within 24 hours and add it to your account.

### **What file types are supported?**

We currently support Excel (XLS and XLSX only) and searchable PDF operating statements that have been exported from a property management systems, such as Yardi or Entrata. Note that certain PDF’s will not process and will require our manual processing team to add this data to your account. This PDF’s are: 

* Scanned PDFs
* PDFs that have been manually manipulated
* PDFs containing non-operating statement data, such as cover letters, notes to the financial statements, or graphs

### **What should I do if my file is unsupported?**

redIQ offers multiple, alternate avenues for adding your data into our system if your file is unsupported by the Operating Statement Processor.  

* First, if your file is an Excel file, you can still use our [manual entry or copy-and-paste tools](https://rediq.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360036412071-Manually-Uploading-Operating-Statements)
* Additionally, you may submit any of your operating statements to our manual processing team, who will process your file and add the data to your account within 24 hours.
