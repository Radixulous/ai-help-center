#### Beta Feature

This feature is currently in a free beta ahead of redIQ’s release of a standalone add-on, the Lifecycle Management Suite (“LMS”), focused on tracking the health and performance of portfolio properties. This feature will eventually be available only to LMS subscribers, but to deliver immediate value, redIQ has decided to make these features temporarily available to all users free of charge.

### **OVERVIEW**

Understanding the financial performance of a deal is essential for making informed investment decisions. Two crucial financial metrics used to evaluate multifamily properties are Net Operating Income (NOI) and Net Income. Both metrics provide insights into a property's financial health, enabling investors to make better-informed choices.

### ***What is the in-app experience with Below NOI?***

The goal of this feature is to provide users greater visibility into their deals and underwriting assumptions. redIQ clients who utilize the *Below NOI (“BNOI”)* feature will have the ability to upload operating statement data that includes account codes mapped below the NOI such as Debt Service, Capital Expenditures, Replacement Reserves, and other similar accounts.

### ***How do I upload operating statements that contain below NOI line items?***

The process of adding new accounts is unchanged - you will just need to add the new account name, create the code, then select the appropriate redIQ Category from the drop-down list which now includes the Below NOI categories.
