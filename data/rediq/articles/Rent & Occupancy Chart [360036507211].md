The Rent & Occupancy chart appears on the Revenue Analysis page within Operating Statements.  This chart compares Physical Occupancy to Net Rental Income.  It uses exclusively monthly data from uploaded Operating Statement data. This chart is intended to highlight the relationship between changes in Rent and Physical Occupancy.

| Key Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| **Physical Occupancy** | 1 + (Vacancy / Potential Market Rent) |
| **Net Rental Income** | Potential Market Rent + Loss to Lease + Vacancy + Concessions + Non-Revenue Units |
| **$ per occ. unit** | total Net Rental Income / (total Units \* Physical Occupancy) |

The intent of the $/occupied unit metric is to more closely estimate Net Rental Income for each unit being leased by adjusting for fluctuations in occupancy.  $ per unit is defined as total Net Rental Income / total Units.
