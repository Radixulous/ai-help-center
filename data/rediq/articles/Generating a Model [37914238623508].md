## Enabling Macros

When you press OK you will download the model in an Excel file. Click the file to open it. If it opens in "Protected View" you will see a yellow bar at the top of the document with an "Enable Editing" button.

![The screenshot shows a document interface with a focus on security features. Here's a detailed description:
1. \*\*Main Interface Elements:\*\*
- \*\*Menu Bar:\*\* At the top, there is a menu bar with tabs labeled "File," "Home," "Insert," "Draw," "Page Layout," "Formulas," "Data," "Review," "View," "Automate," and "Help." These tabs suggest various functionalities like editing, layout adjustments, data manipulation, and automation.
2. \*\*Highlighted Area:\*\*
- \*\*Yellow Security Bar:\*\* Directly below the menu bar, there is a prominent yellow bar indicating "PROTECTED VIEW." This bar serves as a warning about potential security risks when opening files from the internet.
3.](attachments/37921587016596.png)

Clicking that may then populate a new Security Risk message. The model relies on macros for its most powerful features and will not work without unblocking macros.

![This screenshot displays the interface of a spreadsheet application, likely Microsoft Excel, with the following elements:
1. \*\*Ribbon Menu\*\*:
- \*\*Tabs\*\*: Includes "File," "Home," "Insert," "Page Layout," "Formulas," "Data," "Review," "View," "Automate," and "Help."
- \*\*Home Tab\*\*: Selected and active, showing various tools and options.
2. \*\*Clipboard Section\*\*:
- Buttons for "Paste," "Cut," "Copy," and "Format Painter."
3. \*\*Font Section\*\*:
- Dropdown for font selection (currently "Calibri").
- Font size dropdown (set to 10).
- Bold, Italic, and Underline buttons](attachments/37921587018004.png)

To disable these security features, you will want to create a trusted folder that models can be saved to in order to reduce manual override for each file. **Details can be found here:** [**Blocked Macros in valuationIQ Model**](https://rediq.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9034902945812-Blocked-Macros-in-valuationIQ-Model)**.**

If you want to override a single file, you can do so by finding the file in its folder, right clicking the file and selecting Properties.

![This screenshot displays the Properties window for a file on a Windows operating system. Here’s a detailed description:
- \*\*Main Interface Elements:\*\*
- \*\*Tabs:\*\* At the top, there are several tabs: General, Digital Signatures, Security, Details, and Previous Versions. The "General" tab is currently selected.
- \*\*Buttons:\*\* At the bottom, there are three buttons: OK, Cancel, and Apply.
- \*\*Highlighted Areas:\*\*
- There is a red box around the "Unblock" checkbox in the Security section, indicating it is a key action point.
- \*\*Text Labels:\*\*
- \*\*File Name:\*\* "05491 - Southwood-322-20250528-0732"
- \*\*](attachments/37921602491668.png)

Check the "Unblock" box and press OK. You will then be able to use macros in the selected document.
