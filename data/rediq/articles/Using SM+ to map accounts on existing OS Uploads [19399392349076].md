**How to use SmartMap+ to map accounts on existing OS uploads**

Yes, you can use SM+ to re-map accounts on existing OS uploads. While in the deal you wish to re-map, navigate to the Source Data page. Next, select the batch that you want to re-map and then press the "Mappings" button and select ‘SmartMap+’ from the list.

Next, leave the “Override Existing Mappings” box checked in the SmartMap+ dialog box and press "Apply"

![The screenshot displays a dialog box from a SaaS application interface, likely related to the redIQ platform. Here’s a detailed description:
- \*\*Dialog Box Title\*\*: "Smart Map+" is prominently displayed at the top, indicating the feature being used.
- \*\*Main Text\*\*: Below the title, there is a question: "Would you like us to apply our SmartMap+?" This suggests that the user is being prompted to apply a specific mapping feature.
- \*\*Checkbox Option\*\*:
- \*\*Label\*\*: "Override Existing Mappings"
- \*\*State\*\*: The checkbox is checked, indicating that existing mappings will be overridden if the user proceeds.
- \*\*Help Icon\*\*: A small question mark icon next to the checkbox](attachments/19432791844244.png)

This will apply the SmartMap+ account mappings to the existing OS. You can repeat this process for any additional batches in that deal.
