If you forgot your password you can reset it by clicking the corresponding button on the redIQ log in screen. A screen will appear to enter your username and you'll receive an email with a link to reset your password.

In most cases your username will be your email address, but if you can't remember it or you have not yet received an email to reset your password after multiple attempts, please follow the "**Forgot Username**" or "**Didn't Receive Reset Email**" links to contact redIQ Support.
