"By clicking on Sharing," it will lead you to a deal log of shared deals among colleagues. Clicking "new" will allow to create a shareable link that is saved to the library.

Then, designate an expiration date (if needed), select which items you'd like the recipient to see, and add any additional information in the comments to share. Once complete, select share (upper right).

From here, the site will generate a link in which you can send to as many individuals (either with a redIQ account or without) and they can access your deal.

##### **Note**

*The receiver of a shared deal cannot edit the deal. They will have to make a copy of the deal then edit from there*
