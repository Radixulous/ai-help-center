***Apart of a large team?***

Consider setting a Filter with only your name, or your immediate team member’s names, listed in Assigned To.  This way, when you login, you’ll only see your team’s deal log activity.

You’ll still have access to all of the data within your account, however a simplfied view makes it easier to jump into your workflow.

Lastly, you’ll also notice the Search by Deal Name at the top of the deal log.  Whether you have a filter on or not, you can always easily jump to your deal by searching for it by name.
