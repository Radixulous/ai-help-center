redIQ supports the creation of single-site, single-family rental deals made up of multiple homes, in dataIQ. The process for creating these deals is the same as creating multifamily deals.

#### An 'Asset Type' Must Be Set on Deals

To support SFR (and other asset types in the future) users must to specify an asset type: single-family rental (SFR), or multifamily; for every deal they create. Requiring a deal asset type is necessary to make your data more precise and valuable.

### **What are single-family rental assets?**

Single-family rentals are groups of single-family homes rented out to tenants. There are two types of single-family rental assets:

1. Single-site refers to a contiguous portfolio of homes, meaning all units (homes) are in a single subdivision or neighborhood.
2. Scattered-site SFR refers to a portfolio of individual homes located across various locations.

### **What assets will redIQ support?**

* redIQ supports only single-site SFR properties made up of multiple homes.
* In both single-family asset types, single-site and scattered-site, the “collection” of homes is considered a single asset.
* Each home must be built and available for lease.
* SFR is considered an asset that is not currently under construction
* redIQ does not support the uploading of build-for-rent (BFR) properties made up of single-family homes.
