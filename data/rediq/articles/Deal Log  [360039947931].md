The Deal Log is the home page of the app and the first page you land on when you log in. The Deal Log lists the deals that have been created in your account and includes columns with the information about those deals that you choose to see.

### **Settings**

To manage the way the deal log is displayed, click the settings button in the upper right area of the screen next to the search bar.

You can group deals by one specific category, and then choose less or more information to view in the deal log’s display columns.

### **Save a View**

Use the checkbox in the bottom left to save settings for next visit will be selected.  This means every time the you log into redIQ, the deal log will appear with these settings in place.

### **Filtering**

You can group deals by several categories, choosing multiple options in each category if needed.  Then, toward the upper right, you can Save Filters, this way your deal log only populates information according to your filters:

#### Part of a large team?

Consider setting a Filter with only your name, or your immediate team member’s names, listed in Assigned To.  This way, when you login, you’ll only see your team’s deal log activity. You’ll still have access to all of the data within your account, however a simplified view makes it easier to jump into your workflow.

### **Searching**

There is a search bar at the top of the deal log screen where you can search for a deal by name at any time.  Whether you have a filter on or not, you can always easily jump to your deal by searching for it by name.
