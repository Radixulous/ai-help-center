Occupied units with a lease expiration date before the as of date of a rent roll are labeled as MTM leases. They can be excluded on the Rent Roll Dashboard or Floor Plan Summary by selecting the corresponding filter in the Report Settings. There is also a MTM column in the rent roll itself so MTM leases can easily be identified and filtered when mining through the rent roll data.
