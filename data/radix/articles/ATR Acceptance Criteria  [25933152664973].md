Monitoring the number of available apartments aids in your daily tasks and provides direction for necessary improvements. Radix only tracks the number of apartments that currently are, or that will be available in the upcoming 60 days 

#### Apartments to Rent ATR = Vacant Units +  On-Notice Units

ATR % = [(# Vacant Units + # On-Notice Units)/ Total Units at Property]

As you take care to input the correct numbers on the survey, we have proactively ensured to eliminate typos and errors in your data. To maintain high data quality standards, we've established the following acceptance criteria for ATR

+ You can not enter a number higher than the number of total units of the property
+ For stabilized properties, the sum of the ATR % and Leased % must be between 90%-120%
+ For lease-up properties, the sum of Leased % and ATR % must be between 0%-120%

When the criteria above are not followed an ATR flag will be shown ............
