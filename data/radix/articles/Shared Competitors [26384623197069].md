A *shared competitor* is any property on your market survey that another Benchmark customer also includes as a competitor on their market survey. Sharing competitors with other Benchmark customers can help you streamline the collection of market survey data. How?

Within our platform, only one of each property can exist; when a shared competitor's property survey has been updated by another Benchmark customer, the survey is automatically up to date for you as well.

### Identifying Shared Competitors

You can easily identify shared competitors on your market survey by navigating to the Competitors table on your Benchmark and RealRents page.

* Shared competitors will display a share icon to the right of the property's name. Hover over the share icon to see a list of additional Benchmark customers who also include the property as a competitor on their market survey.

**Pro Tip:** You can still update a property's survey and Improve its score, even if the property's survey was recently updated by a shared competitor. Simply click Edit property surveys in the far left column of the Competitorr updates, or click Improve score.
