ProForma provides you with a variety of built-in tools to efficiently evaluate your custom property. The Competitors portion of your custom property's dashboard is one such tool.

The Competitors table allows you to view market survey data for the competitors you've selected.

Read on to learn more about how to customize what data you see, and how to obtain the most recently published survey data for competitors.

### Customizing the Competitors Table

When you've added competitors to your custom property, you can view and interact with their weekly market survey data using the tools found here.

* Use the Preferences gear to select the specific data columns you want to see on the table. ![Table showing competitor properties with occupancy, lease percentages, and units. Column settings open.](attachments/16432176016141.png)

* Sort properties by a specific data point by clicking the arrows in the column headings.![A table listing properties with details like year built, occupancy, units, and rent.](attachments/16432254736781.png)

* Click the (+) sign located to the left of each property's name to view relevant data points and metrics (i.e., NER, Rent, # of Units, etc.) by unit type. ![Dashboard showing property data: units, sqft, rent, concessions, NER, and NER/sqft by address.](attachments/16432509907213.png)

### Obtaining Updated Survey Data

Your dashboard makes it easy to identify when the last property survey was completed for each property with colored clock icons. Hover over the clock to see the exact date the last property survey was completed.

* A **green** clock means the property survey was updated within the past 7 days.
* An **orange** clock means the property survey was updated within the past 8 - 14 days.
* A**red** clock means the property survey was updated in 15+ days.

If you're looking for more recent property survey data, ProForma offers two ways to obtain it. You can:

* **Refresh the Property Survey:** Use the Refresh feature to pull in the property's most recently published survey data from Benchmark.
* **Create a New Property Survey:** Use the New Property Survey feature to add the property's survey data yourself.
