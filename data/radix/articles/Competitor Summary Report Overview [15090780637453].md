The Competitor Summary Report offers a side-by-side comparison of property metrics and information for a subject property and its' selected competitors. In addition to overall property metrics such as Occupancy %, NER, Concessions, etc., the report includes metric comparisons at a floor plan level.

Use this report anytime you're looking for a clear and visual comparison of metrics and information at a property level.

**Pro Tip**

When was the last time you evaluated the competitors selected for your property? The information outlined in this report can help you hone in on factors like Year Built, Construction Type, and NER that are often used to select relevant comparable properties

### Accessing the Report

To access the Competitor Summary Report, click the *Reports* tab in the top menu bar, then select *Competitor Summary* from the report options.

### Customizing the Report

Use the following drop-down menus to tailor the report to your needs:

* **Property:** Search for a property within your portfolio or select the property you want to run the report for. (The competitor properties assigned to the property you choose will automatically be included in the report once it is run.)
* **Perspective:** Applying a perspective allows you to further customize the properties in your analysis. For example, maybe you only want to compare lease-up properties in your report. Using a perspective would allow you to do this. For more information on how to create a perspective, check out [How to Use Perspectives.](https://help.radix.com/hc/en-us/articles/7313516628749)
* **Date Range:** Choose from one of the date ranges provided or enter a custom range of your choosing.
* **Preferences:**Choose whether you want your subject property to be included in the table view of the report.

Click *Run Report* after you've made your selections.
