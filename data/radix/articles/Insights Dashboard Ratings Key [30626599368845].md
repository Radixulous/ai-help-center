The Strong, Fair, and Weak ratings on your [Insights Dashboard](https://help.radix.com/hc/en-us/articles/30539442634253) are one of many tools designed to help you analyze the strength of the supply and demand indicators that can impact your property's performance. Using these ratings makes it quicker than ever to evaluate whether your property has the traffic and leasing velocity needed to keep unhealthy levels of apartments to rent (ATR) at bay.

Use the ratings key below to understand the thresholds and logic that trigger these ratings.

**Note:** Different logic and thresholds are used for stabilized vs. lease-up properties. The ratings you see for comps represent the average performance seen for all of the property's comps.

### **Apartments to Rent (ATR) %**

#### Stabilized properties

| Rating | Logic |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Weak | ATR is greater than 10% and the trailing 30 day ATR trend is improving, flat or declining. |
| Strong | ATR is 6% or below and the trailing 30 day ATR trend is improving, flat or declining. |
| Fair | ATR is between 6 - 10% and the trailing 30 day ATR trend is improving, flat or declining. |

#### Lease-up properties

| Rating | Logic |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Weak | ATR % is increasing OR is improving at a significantly slower pace than what is required to achieve a 6% ATR at the selected stabilization date. |
| Strong | ATR % is improving at the required pace to achieve a 6% ATR on or before the selected stabilization date. |
| Fair | ATR % is improving at a slightly slower pace than what is required to achieve a 6% ATR at the selected stabilization date. |

#### Comp averages

| Rating | Logic |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Weak | The average ATR for all comps is greater than 10% and the trailing 30 day ATR trend is improving, flat or declining. |
| Strong | The average ATR for all comps is 6% or below and the trailing 30 day ATR trend is improving, flat or declining. |
| Fair | The average ATR for all comps is between 6 - 10% and the trailing 30 day ATR trend is improving, flat or declining. |

### **Leases per Week**

#### Stabilized properties

| Rating | Logic |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Weak | The number of net leases secured over the past 7 calendar days did not meet the required amount to maintain Strong ATR% in the next 60 days, and the trailing 30 day leases per week trend is declining. |
| Strong | The number of net leases secured over the past 7 calendar days met or exceeded the required amount to maintain Strong ATR% in the next 60 days. |
| Fair | The number of net leases secured over the past 7 calendar days did not meet the required amount to maintain Strong ATR% in the next 60 days, but the trailing 30 day leases per week trend is improving. |

#### Lease up properties

| Rating | Logic |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Weak | The number of net leases secured over the past 7 calendar days did not meet the required amount to achieve a Strong ATR% on or before the selected stabilization date, and the 30 day leases per week trend is flat or declining. |
| Strong | The number of net leases secured over the past 7 calendar days met or exceeded the required amount to achieve a Strong ATR% on or before the selected stabilization date. |
| Fair | The number of net leases secured over the pat 7 calendar days did not meet the required amount to achieve a Strong ATR% on or before the selected stabilization date, but the 30 day leases per week trend is improving. |

#### Comp averages

| Rating | Logic |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Weak | The average number of net leases secured by comps in the past 7 calendar days did not meet the required amount to achieve or maintain a Strong ATR% in the next 60 days, and the trailing 30 day leases per week trend is declining. |
| Strong | The average number of net leases secured by comps in the past 7 calendar days met or exceeded the required amount to achieve or maintain Strong ATR% in the next 60 days. |
| Fair | The average number of net leases secured by comps in the past 7 calendar days did not meet the required amount to achieve or maintain a Strong ATR% in the next 60 days, but the trailing 30 day leases per week trend is improving. |

### **Traffic per Week**

#### Stabilized properties

| Rating | Logic |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Weak | Based on the average 6 week closing ratio, traffic volume over the past 7 calendar days is insufficient to convert enough leases to achieve or maintain a 6% ATR trend, and the trailing 30 day traffic per week trend is declining. |
| Strong | Based on the average 6 week closing ratio, traffic volume over the past 7 calendar days meets or exceeds the amount needed to convert enough leases to achieve or maintain a 6% ATR trend. |
| Fair | Based on the average 6 week closing ratio, traffic volume over the past 7 calendar days is insufficient to convert enough leases to achieve or maintain a 6% ATR trend, but the trailing 30 day traffic per week trend is improving. |

#### Lease up properties

| Rating | Logic |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Weak | Based on the average 6 week closing ratio, traffic volume over the past 7 calendar days is insufficient to convert enough leases to achieve a Strong ATR% on or before the selected stabilization date, and the trailing 30 day traffic per week trend is flat or declining. |
| Strong | Based on the average 6 week closing ratio, traffic volume over the past 7 calendar days meets or exceeds the amount needed to convert enough leases to achieve a Strong ATR % on or before the selected stabilization date. |
| Fair | Based on the average 6 week closing ratio, traffic volume over the past 7 calendar days is insufficient to convert enough leases to achieve a Strong ATR% on or before the selected stabilization date, but the trailing 30 day traffic per week trend is improving. |

#### Comp averages
