Our perspectives feature allows you to exclude certain competitor data when benchmarking your property's performance. No two properties are exactly alike; by excluding specific floor plans or an entire competitor property, you can obtain a more apples-to-apples comparison.

Common scenarios where a perspective can come in handy are:

* **Renovations:** You have a competitor who's started renovations and you want to exclude their renovated units when comparing property performance.
* **Affordable Units:** A property you consider to be a competitor has affordable units. Apply a perspective to exclude their affordable units when benchmarking your property's performance.
* **Lease-Up Properties:** You're a lease-up property with stabilized and lease-up competitors. Apply a perspective to only benchmark against other lease-up properties.

**Accessing Perspectives**

Within Radix, there are three areas where you can access the perspectives feature:

* From a property's dashboard within Benchmark.

* From a custom property's dashboard within ProForma.

* From within different Radix reports (i.e., Market Survey Summary Report, Floor Plan Comparison Report, etc.).

#### Note:

Where you can access the perspectives feature will depend on the Radix products you have access to. While all Radix users have access to Radix Reports, not all users have access to Benchmark and/or ProForma.

**Creating a Perspective**

Before you can use a perspective, you need to create one. To create a perspective:

* Select *Add/Edit Perspectives* from the Perspectives drop-down menu.

* Use the Perspective field to enter a name for your perspective.

* Next, use the checkboxes to de-select the specific floor plan unit types you want to exclude. Each competitor's floor plans and their associated unit types will be outlined per competitor.
  + In the below example, we've de-selected all 3x2 floor plans in order to create our perspective.

* Click *Save* once you've made your desired selections.

**Editing & Locking Perspectives**

You can easily edit your perspective, and prevent others from being able to make edits to the perspectives you've created.

**Editing Perspectives**

To make a change to a perspective you've created:

* Simply click the pencil icon next to the perspective's name, make the edits you desire, then click *Save* to update the perspective with your changes.

**Locking Perspectives**

If you don't want other users to edit the perspectives you've created, be sure to lock them.

Locking a perspective will still allow others to use the perspective you've created, but prevents them from editing it.

* + To lock a perspective, click the lock icon located to the right of the perspective's name. ![Lock icon next to "Excluding 3 Bedroom Floor Plans" indicating locked perspective.](attachments/17547795644045.png)
  + A lock icon will appear next to the perspective's name, indicating it is now locked to changes from any user other than you.

#### Applying Perspectives

After you've created a perspective, it will automatically appear within the Perspectives drop-down menu for you to utilize.  ![Dropdown menu showing apartment data perspectives and date range options.](attachments/17547749872525.png)

After you've applied a perspective, your screen will refresh, and a label will appear to demonstrate the perspective has been applied. When a perspective has been applied, the data you see on the Snapshot, Trends, and Competitors areas of the property dashboard will be impacted.  ![Property dashboard showing apartment rankings, prices, and occupancy data in Scottsdale, AZ.](attachments/17547749874829.png)
