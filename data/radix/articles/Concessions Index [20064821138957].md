In this article we'll define what this data point is, how it's calculated, and outline practical tips and tools you can use to evaluate your Concessions Index data.

Definition Why it Matters

Concessions Index refers to the percentage of annual rent that has been devoted to monetary concessions. This data point is calculated at the property level and incorporates concession and rent values for available units in its calculations.

Concessions are strategically offered to incentivize prospects to rent. Monitoring Concessions Index helps those invested in the success of a property position it competitively while also monitoring the impact those concessions will have on rental income. Analyzing how this data point is changing over time for a comp set and the wider market can also provide valuable insights into the health of the market you operate within. For example, sudden or sustained increases in Concessions Index may indicate a surplus of available units or waning demand for units in a locale.

### Calculating Concessions Index

Radix calculates Concessions Index at the property level and expresses this data point as a percentage. The average concessions are divided by the average annual rent to help you understand what percentage of available unit's annual rent is being devoted to concessions. **[(Avg. Concessions) / (Average Rent \* 12) ] X 100%**

* **Average Concessions:** Includes one-time and recurring monetary concessions offered for a property's available units.
* **Average Rent:** This is the average monthly rent for all available units. This average is then multiplied by 12 to convert the average from monthly to annual.

### Evaluating Concessions Index

Concessions are strategically offered to increase a property's ability to compete within its comp set and market. By pairing your Concessions Index data with the additional real-time data Radix provides, you can make more informed decisions to shape your concessions strategy. Here are a few tools and tips to help you do so.

* **Benchmark Performance:** Your [Snapshot](https://help.radix.com/hc/en-us/articles/9060091043981) feature can act as your investigative companion when analyzing performance. Use this to monitor how Concessions Index has changed over time for your property and each of it's competitors. Additional data points like rent, traffic, leases, and ATR will help you paint a picture of what's happening with concessions within the property's comp set and *why*.
* **Conduct a Trends Analysis:** Our [Trends Analysis Report](https://help.radix.com/hc/en-us/articles/15181922028429) allows you to stack data trends for key metrics like ATR, Traffic and Leases per Week, and Closing Ratio. It's a great tool to help analyze whether concessions offered are contributing to a property's ability to drive traffic, secure leases, and minimize exposure.
* **Analyze Floor Plan Concessions:**Concessions data can be viewed at the floor plan *and* unit level. Use the [Trends](https://help.radix.com/hc/en-us/articles/9060097289101) feature to explore concessions for different floor plans, or use the [Floor Plan Comparison Report](https://help.radix.com/hc/en-us/articles/15100961400845) for comprehensive details on what concessions are being offered for specific units.
