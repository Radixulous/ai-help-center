The Concessions Report offers valuable information for those seeking to understand and strategize on a single property's concessions.

It can be used to help address questions such as:

* What concessions has the property been offering?
* What concessions has a property's competitors been offering?
* What's the average concessions being offered and how does a property compare?
* Are the concessions we're offering being given at the expense of NER?

#### **Accessing the Report**

To access the Concessions Report, click the *Reports* tab in the top menu bar, then select *Concessions*from the report options.

#### **Customizing the Report**

Use the following drop-down menus to tailor the report to your needs:

* **Property:** Search for a property within your portfolio or select the property you want to run the report for.
* **Perspective:** Applying a perspective allows you to further customize the properties in your analysis. For example, maybe you only want to compare lease-up properties in your report. Using a perspective would allow you to do this. For more information on how to create a perspective, check out [How to Use Perspectives.](https://help.radix.com/hc/en-us/articles/7313516628749)
* **Date Range:** Choose from one of the date ranges provided or enter a custom range of your choosing.
* **Preferences:**Choose the competitor properties you would like included in the report.

Click *Run Report* after you've made your selections.
