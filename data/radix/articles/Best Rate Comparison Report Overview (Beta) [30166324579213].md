The Best Rate Comparison Report allows you to investigate how your lowest available rental rates compare to your comps. Each Monday, this report will refresh with data sourced from integrated property management systems and data scraped from the web to bring you the lowest rental rates found for available floor plans.

You can rely on this report when you want to know:

* What the lowest advertised rental rates are for different floor plans.
* What lease lengths are associated with the lowest advertised rental rates.
* How your property's lowest advertised rates compare to your comps.

**Note:** This report is currently only available for Radix Benchmark users.

### Accessing the Report

To access the Best Rate Comparison Report, click the *Reports* tab in the top menu bar. Then select, Best Rate Comparison from the report options.

### Customizing the Report

Use the following drop-down menus to tailor the report to your needs:

* **Property:** Search for a property within your portfolio or select the property you want to run the report for.
* **Perspective:** Applying a perspective allows you to exclude specific floor plans you don't want to include in your analysis for a more apples-to-apples comparison. For example, maybe you only want to compare renovated floor plans in your report. Using a perspective would allow you to do this. For more information on how to create a perspective, check out [How to Use Perspectives.](https://help.radix.com/hc/en-us/articles/7313516628749)
* **Preferences:**Choose the properties you would like included in the report. Here you can also select any metrics you want to remove from the report columns.

Click *Run Report* after you've made your selections.

### Viewing the Report

Once the report is run, it will organize data by floor plan to make benchmarking rental rates easier for you.

* Any data associated with your property will be displayed in **bold text**so you can visually differentiate your property from others.
* The data found in this report is updated every Monday; if you run the report prior to Monday, it will show data from the previous week.
