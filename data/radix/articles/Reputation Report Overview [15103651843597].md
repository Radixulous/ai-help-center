In today's digital day and age, the impact of online reviews on a property's performance cannot be understated.

Our Reputation Report can be used by any individual who wants to:

+ Maintain visibility on a property's reviews.
+ Understand how a property's reviews compare to specific competitor's reviews.
+ Evaluate how a property's reviews fare in relation to the competitor average.

### Accessing the Report

To access the Reputation report, click the *Reports* tab in the top menu bar, then select *Reputation* from the report options.

### Viewing the Report

The number of reviews, and the average star rating per property is outlined for Yelp and Google on this report.

To further investigate reviews, you can click on the number of reviews outlined next to the star rating. This will take you to the review site referenced.

**Pro Tip:** Take note of the Comp Averages listed at the bottom of the report. This is the average star rating of all competitors you've selected in the Preferences menu. Are the quantity and rating of your property's reviews higher or lower than the competitor average?
