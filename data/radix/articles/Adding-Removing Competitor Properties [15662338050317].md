Whether you no longer consider a specific property to be a competitor, or have found a new property you want to add as a competitor, Benchmark has the built-in tools needed to quickly update your competitor set. Follow the steps outlined below to easily add or remove competitor properties.

### Accessing Manage Comps

All the tools you need to manage comps for your property are located in the Manage Comps section of Radix. To access this page:

* Click the profile icon found in the upper right-hand corner of your screen. Then select *Manage Properties* from the menu that appears.

Then, select *Manage Comps* from the menu that appears. ![Property management table with a dropdown menu open, highlighting "Manage Comps" option.](attachments/28884600402317.png)

### Managing your Comps

The Manage Comps page outlines the list of comps currently in use for a property, along with an interactive map. Each comp will display a similarity score auto-generated by Radix based on how similar they are to your property. The interactive map will showcase numbered pins to help you visualize where each competitor is located. It will also display all properties within the area with a white pin.

You can have up to 10 comps and have multiple options available to manage the property's comps:

1. **CompMatch (Recommended Comps):** CompMatch uses an advanced algorithm to generate competitor recommendations for you based on how similar a property is to yours. Learn more about the CompMatch algorithm and how to add recommended comps by clicking [here.](https://help.radix.com/hc/en-us/articles/19966348215565)
2. **Add comps from the map:** You can leverage our built-in map feature to locate and view properties within close proximity to yours.
3. **Search comps by name or address:** You can directly search for a property by its name or address when you have that information.
4. **Deleting a comp:** Simply click the trash icon next to a property's name to remove them as a comp.
