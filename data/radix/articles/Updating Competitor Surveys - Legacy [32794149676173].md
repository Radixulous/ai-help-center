When updating your weekly market survey in Benchmark, your goal is to have updated and quality data for your property *and* each of the competitors you've elected to include on your market survey. In this article, we'll break down how to update your competitor surveys and increase data quality scores as needed.

### Identifying out-of-date competitors

The Competitor updates table on your RealRent page displays three different colored clock icons to help you easily identify when a survey needs to be updated.

* **Green Clock:** Indicates the property's survey was updated within the last 7 days.
* **Orange Clock:** Indicates the property's survey was updated within the last 8 - 14 days.
* **Red Clock:** Indicates it has been 15+ days since the property's survey was updated.

### Updating out-of-date competitors

Your goal each week is to have every competitor on your market survey display a green clock. When you encounter an orange or red clock, click Update property to access and update the property's survey.

### Increasing data quality scores

A data quality score is given to every property survey that has been updated within the past week. Data quality scores are based on missing values and data anomalies found by our advanced algorithms.

* If you notice a low data quality score for one of your competitors, you can review and resolve the potential data issues driving the score by clicking *Improve Score.*

* A new window will appear. Here you can resolve any potential data issues and achieve a 100% score by using either of the two options:![Data Quality Score at 98% with one issue: NER above expected range for 10 units, 800 sqft, $11,712.](attachments/32794125710093.png)

  - **Enter an updated value:** Call or email the property and confirm whether the value entered is correct. If the value needs to be updated, you can enter an updated value and resolve the data issue.
  - **Verify the value is accurate:** If you've verified with the property the value is correct, click *The entered value is correct* to resolve the data issue.
