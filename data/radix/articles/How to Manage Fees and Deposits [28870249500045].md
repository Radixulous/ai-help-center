***Fees and Deposits*** allow users to track custom fees and deposits for their subject property and/or comps. For example, in an urban area where monthly parking can be a significant source of other income, users can now track parking fees using the *Fees and Deposits Report*. It can also be used to track locator fees and even RUBS/utility bill backs.Â  Competitors often lower or waive fees and deposits as a way to entice prospective residents into signing a lease. This might play a role in the decision-making of a prospect, especially if lower move-in costs are important to them, which is why Radix allows users to set up custom fees and deposits and track them accordingly.
