To streamline the collection of real-time survey data, Radix has introduced web-scraped data. Main metrics — such as occupancy %, leased %, and net leases per week — are automatically pre-populated into competitor surveys three times a week (Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday) for properties of competitors who are not Radix subscribers.

#### Identifying Surveys with Web-Scraped Data

To determine whether web-scraped data has been pre-populated in a property survey, look for a mark on the competitor’s table indicating that web-scraped data is present. If one of your competitors is marked as 'User Generated', it means that web-scraped survey information is not available for that property in the latest update.

Web-scraped data is sourced directly from publicly available information like property websites, and its purpose is to reduce manual entry. However, if no new data is found, an 'Update Property' button will be available on the right side, allowing you to manually enter or edit the survey values.

Even with web scraped data available, you have the option to improve data quality by entering in data values that are not available via web scraping like traffic or concessions.

**Note:** If data is automatically updated, you only need to update traffic and improve data quality if necessary. Concessions, if available, can be updated separately in the Concessions section. This approach helps maintain consistency and avoids unnecessary confusion.
