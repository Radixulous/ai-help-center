When you create a custom ProForma property, you can find competitors and use their published market survey data for your underwriting endeavors. There are three ways you can locate a competitor to add:

1. **CompMatch (Recommended Comps):** CompMatch uses an advanced algorithm to generate competitor recommendations for you based on how similar a property is to yours. Learn more about the CompMatch algorithm by clicking [here.](https://help.radix.com/hc/en-us/articles/19966348215565)
2. **Add Competitors from a Map:** You can leverage our built-in map feature to locate and view properties within close proximity to yours.
3. **Search Competitors by Name or Address:** You can directly search for a property by its name or address when you have that information.

Read on for step-by-step guidance on how to locate and add competitors for each of these options.

### Adding Competitors to Your ProForma Property

**CompMatch (Recommended Comps)**

When CompMatch has recommended properties for you to consider, you can easily access and review these recommendations directly from your custom property's Competitors Dashboard.

**Step 1:** Simply click the building icon located on the Competitors Dashboard. The number of recommendations you have will be displayed in blue directly above this icon.

**Step 3:** Use the similarity score to help determine whether you'd like to accept or ignore the recommendation. When interacting with this feature, you'll find recommendations broken into three categories.

1. **Recommended Comps:** Displays any new recommendations pending your review. You can either accept or ignore the recommendation.
2. **Considering You as a Comp:** Outlines recommended properties that consider your property to be a comp, but have not been added to your comp set yet.
3. **Ignored Comps:** Shows previous recommendations that were ignored. Clicking the (+) icon to the left of the property's name will give you the ability to see why the property was ignored.

**Step 4**: Use the checkboxes to the left of the property's name to ***Accept*** the recommendation. Once you've selected each of the recommendations you want to add, click *Add Comps.* Use the ***Ignore*** button to the right of the property's similarity score to ignore the recommendation. Clicking ignore will prompt you to enter a reason for ignoring the recommendation.

**Add Comps from a Map**

Any known properties within our ecosystem are plotted out on an interactive map within ProForma for you.

**Step 1:** To access the map, simply click the building icon located on your custom property's Competitors Dashboard. ![Dashboard showing Geta Residential details, occupancy, and competitor data.](attachments/23668882694285.png) **Step 2:** A new window will appear with an interactive map located to the right of the window. Your custom property is denoted on the map by the Radix X. Additional multifamily properties in the area are denoted with a plus (+) symbol to indicate the option to add the property. To add a property, simply click the plus (+) symbol.  ![Map interface showing a property listing with a plus symbol to add it to a list of comps.](attachments/23669426540685.png) **Step 3:** Once you've clicked the plus (+) symbol, the property will appear on the List of Comps for the Property on the left side of the window. A similarity score will be outlined next to the property's name, indicating how similar the property is to your custom property.
