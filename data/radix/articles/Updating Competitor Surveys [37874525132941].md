Updating your daily market survey in RealRents means ensuring current, high-quality data for both your property as well as your select competitors. This article will show you how to find outdated competitor surveys and then guide you on updating them directly within the platform.

Comp data in Radix is updated in a few ways:

* **Via PMS (Property Management System) Integration** – If your competitor is a RealRents subscriber with an active PMS integration, their survey data will update automatically through that connection. Learn more about PMS Integration [here](https://help.radix.com/hc/en-us/articles/7654585462285).
* **Auto Updating with Web-Scraped Data** – occupancy %, leased % and net leases per week are automatically pre-populated with data pulled from publicly available information such as property websites. Web scraped data is pulled in for property that are not yet Radix subscribers. Learn more about web-scraped data [here](https://help.radix.com/hc/en-us/articles/37606736624141).
* **Through Our Shared Ecosystem –** When a competitor’s property survey is completed by one user, it then reflects updated for all users who share that competitor.
* **Manual Survey Update** – You can update a competitor’s survey directly, just like you would your own property.

**Note:**If a competitor is a **Radix subscriber**, their survey data may be locked — meaning you won’t be able to update it manually. This is because the most accurate data comes directly from the source, i.e. the onsite team. However, if the survey hasn’t been updated in 15 days, the property will then be unlocked and able to be edited by other users. Learn more about locked properties [here](https://help.radix.com/hc/en-us/articles/20242439129997).

**Identifying Out-of-Date Competitors:**

To help you easily track which competitor surveys need attention, RealRents uses a clock icon system. The Competitor Updates table displays three colored clock icons, so you can identify when a survey needs to be updated. Learn more about clock colors [here](https://help.radix.com/hc/en-us/articles/37551597222029).

**Updating Out-of-Date Competitors**

Your goal each week is to have every competitor in your market survey display a green clock. When you encounter an orange or red clock, click 'Update property' to access and update the property's survey.

* **Property data:** Enter the property's main metrics such as occupancy %, leased %, traffic, and net leases per week. If your competitors are using web-scraped data, these metrics will be automatically populated, with the exception of traffic.

* **Concessions:** In this step, make sure to add concessions when applicable. For an easier process use the built-in concessions calculator to help calculate the value of any one-time or recurring monthly concessions being offered at the property.

* **Review and submit:** Resolve any issues surfaced by the data quality score in this step. If all is accurate, submit the survey. Learn more about data quality scores [here](https://help.radix.com/hc/en-us/articles/28429466699533).

**Note:** When web-scraped data for your competitors is received, it will be automatically saved three times a week: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Simply update the weekly traffic and record any concessions offered during the update—quick and hassle-free!

**Improving Data Quality Scores**

A data quality score is given to every property survey that has been updated within the past week. These scores are based on missing values and data anomalies found by our advanced algorithms.

If you come across a low score, you can click on Improve **Score** to resolve potential issues. For more details, visit: [Data Quality Scores Explained](https://help.radix.com/hc/en-us/articles/28429466699533)
