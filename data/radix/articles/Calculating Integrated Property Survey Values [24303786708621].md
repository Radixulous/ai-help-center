Integrated property surveys import the majority of a property's information directly from the Property Management Software (PMS) in use (i.e. Yardi, Entrata, ResMan, OneSite).

Imported values are standardized within our software so you can use our built-in benchmarking tools to make uniform property comparisons. We've outlined how these values are calculated below for your reference.

**Note:** If you believe there is a discrepancy with your property's calculated survey values, submit a ticket to our team [here](https://help.radix.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).

### How to Tell if a Property Survey is Integrated

Integrated property surveys will display information for the ***PMS Imported data*** in the upper right-hand corner of the property's survey page. To review the data fed for each step click on ***Integration details***, under Property data on the left side.
