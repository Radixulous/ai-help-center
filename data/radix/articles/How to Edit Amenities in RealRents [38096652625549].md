Amenities help your property stand out and provide clarity for renters. In RealRents, you can manage property-wide, floor plan-specific, or unit-level amenities.

**Updating Amenities**

1. Navigate to the **Amenities** section in the left-hand menu.
2. You’ll see two categories: **Property Amenities** and **Location Amenities**.
3. Check the boxes next to the features your property offers.
