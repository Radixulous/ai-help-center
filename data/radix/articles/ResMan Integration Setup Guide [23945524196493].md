Make weekly survey updates more efficient with our ResMan integration. By utilizing our ResMan integration, the majority of the information your team enters to update their property survey will be imported directly from your property management system.

#### Setting Up Your Integration

Our dedicated support team will collaborate with you to set up and test your integration. Our team simply needs an Account ID provided by your team to get started. Follow the steps below to obtain your Account ID and get started setting up your integration.

**Step 1: Submit an Integration Request to ResMan**

You can create and submit an integration request directly to ResMan through their Knowledge Center. Submitting this request notifies ResMan that your organization is seeking an integration with Radix, and initiates the setup ResMan will need to complete on their end.

For faster ticket resolution times, we recommend doing the following:

* Add *Integration Request* and *Radix* in the subject line of your ticket.
* From the *Product Affected* drop-down menu on the ticket, select *Integration Changes Add/Remove*. Doing so will ensure your ticket is routed to the proper team.
* In the *Description* area, include Radix by name as the vendor partner you want to integrate with and list all the properties you want to integrate with.

**Step 2: Provide Your Account ID from ResMan to Radix**

Once your integration request is received, ResMan will provide you with an Account ID via email.

Please provide this Account ID to Radix by emailing [integrations@radix.com](mailto:onboarding@radix.com). Our team will use this information to configure and test the integration on our end.
