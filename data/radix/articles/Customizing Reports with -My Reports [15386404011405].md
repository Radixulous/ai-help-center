Radix offers a wide variety of reports and each is customizable in unique ways.

My Reports is a section of your Reports page you can save your frequently used and favorite reports to. The settings and preferences you've made to a specific report will be preserved, streamlining the process of pulling the report again in the future.

To customize a report and save it to My Reports you'll want to:

1. Select the report you want to customize.
2. Customize the report with available Preferences.
3. Save the report to My Reports for future use.

### Select Your Report

Navigate to the Reports page and select the report you'd like from the Radix Reports menu.

For this example, we've selected the Property Data Report.

### Customize Your Report Preferences

Available menus for customization will vary based on the report you've selected. However, here are a few common menus you'll find to tailor a report to your specific needs:

* **Properties**: Choose the property(s) you want to include in your reporting.
* **Perspectives:** Applying a perspective allows you to further refine the properties in your analysis. For example, maybe you only want to include lease-up properties for comparison in your report. Or perhaps you want to exclude certain floor plan types like townhomes. Using a perspective would allow you to do this. For more information on how to create a perspective, check out [How to Use Perspectives.](https://help.radix.com/hc/en-us/articles/7313516628749)
* **Date Range:**Select one of the provided date range options for your report.
* **Preferences:**The options within this menu vary based on the report you've selected, but the majority of your available customization options will be found here.
  + Regardless of the options you choose, be sure to click *Update* to save your preferences and *Run Report* to pull the report with those options reflected.

### Save Your Report to My Reports

Find and click the *save* icon to open the **Report Name** window. Give your report a name, then click the secondary *save* button.

Clicking the secondary save button automatically saves your report, and the customizations associated with it, to the My Reports page.

From this page you can view general details per report such as when it was last modified, the type of report it is, and the name you've given it.

#### Additional Report Options

A menu with additional options to engage with your saved reports can be accessed by clicking the horizontal dots to the right of the report.

* **Share:** Make your report an Organization Template here. Learn about the benefits and use cases for doing so [here.](https://help.radix.com/hc/en-us/articles/15328580922637)
* **Email:** You can share your report as a PDF or Excel file via email with this option. Want to automatically email your report on a certain day each week or month? Be sure to use the Schedule feature within this menu.
* **Delete:** If you no longer have need for this report, simply delete it.
