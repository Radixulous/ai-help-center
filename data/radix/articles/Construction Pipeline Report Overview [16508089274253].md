The Construction Pipeline Report allows you to view, export, and share information on multifamily projects at different stages of their construction lifecycle. This report offers high levels of customization and can be used to help address questions such as:

* What projects are scheduled or currently underway?
* Which stage of construction are projects currently at?
* Who's developing in a given area?
* What product type is being developed in a given area?
