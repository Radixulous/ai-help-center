How many apartments does a property have available to rent? Your Apartments to Rent (ATR) metric is critical to continually monitor as it addresses this question for you. In this article, we'll define what this metric is, how Radix calculates it, and offer practical tips for gaining detailed ATR insights you can use to your competitive advantage.

Definition Why it Matters

Apartments to Rent (ATR), also commonly referred to as *exposure* and *availability,* is the number of units a property has available for prospects to lease. ATR can be expressed as a number or percentage and looks at the number of vacant and on-notice units available. Radix helps you monitor each property's**60-day exposure** so you can continually look ahead and strategize for how to mitigate exposure while optimizing asking rents.

For those who have a financial stake in a property, large numbers of available units can signal trouble for a property's ability to drive rental revenue. If left unchecked, high numbers of available units can result in high numbers of vacant, unrented units. When this scenario occurs, a property misses out on the rental income it would obtain if the unit were rented. Proactively monitoring ATR prevents this scenario from occurring and safeguards revenue.

### Calculating ATR Metrics

**ATR as a Number**

Radix calculates ATR by adding the number of units that are currently vacant with the number of unrented, on-notice units coming available *over the next 60 days*. **(# Vacant Units + # On-Notice Units)**

**ATR as a Percentage (%)**

Radix calculates ATR % by adding the number of units that are currently vacant with the number of unrented, on-notice units coming available over the next 60 days. The resulting number is then divided by the total number of units the property has. **[(# Vacant Units + # On-Notice Units)/ Total Units at Property]**

### Evaluating Available to Rent (ATR)

Radix offers real-time data on metrics you can use to better understand a property's ATR. This data can be leveraged to build a strategy around the reduction of ATR. It can also be used to test rents and optimize the asking rents for units becoming available. Here are several tools and tips for evaluating ATR performance.

* **Benchmarking Performance:** Your [Snapshot](https://help.radix.com/hc/en-us/articles/9060091043981) and [Trends](https://help.radix.com/hc/en-us/articles/9060097289101) tools are designed to help you compare your property's performance to its competition. When ATR is high, use these tools to investigate why. Is enough traffic being driven to the property? What properties are achieving traffic and why? Are rents and concessions competitive? Is the property able to effectively close on leases?
* **Comparing Floor Plan Availability:**Use your [Floor Plan Comparison Report](https://help.radix.com/hc/en-us/articles/15100961400845) to see the specific floor plan and unit types your property is competing with. With this report, you can view available units by floor plan and unit type. You can also explore how your property's available units compare for metrics like rent and concessions that impact availability as well.
* **Analyzing Rents:** Whether ATR is high or low, the goal is to optimize the rent of available units. The Scatter Plot chart within your [Market Survey Summary Report](https://help.radix.com/hc/en-us/articles/15109001351053) helps you analyze rent performance opportunities at the floor plan level. The floor plan types offered by a property and its comps are plotted out, with a trend line for your property and a trend line representing a comp average. Use this chart to help visualize rent deltas between similar-sized floor plans.
