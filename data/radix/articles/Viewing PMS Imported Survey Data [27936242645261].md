When you need to verify how your imported property survey values have been calculated, the ***Integration Details*** on your property survey will offer you a detailed view. You can use this detailed view to:

* View what survey values (i.e., Occupancy %, Leased %, ATR, Rents, etc.) have been imported.
* View how imported survey values were calculated.

Imported values are standardized within Radix so you can use our built-in benchmarking tools to make uniform property comparisons. For details on how we calculate each data point, [click here.](https://help.radix.com/hc/en-us/articles/24303786708621)

**We're Here to Help!** If you feel there is a discrepancy with any of your imported survey values, submit a ticket to our team [here](https://help.radix.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) for assistance.

### Accessing Integration Details

You can access Integration Details for a property by navigating into its property survey. To view the detailed information on how imported survey data has been calculated, click the hyperlinked *Integration details* text.

This detailed view is available on steps 1 - 3 of the survey since these steps contain the data points our integration calculates using your property management system's (PMS) data.

When navigating the integration details on the Rent page, the **Unit Price Strategy** can help you determine which of the following strategies were used to calculate the rent value for the floor plan. Clicking *View Details* will offer more granular information on the specific units factored into the calculation.

1. **Asking Rents:** When units are available, Radix reflects the average asking rent (including amenities) of all units within the unit type that are becoming available in the next 60 days.
2. **Achieved Rents:** If no units are available, Radix reflects the average achieved rent (including amenities) for all units within the unit type that have been leased in the last 30 days, and move-ins scheduled for the next 60 days.
3. **Market Rents:** If achieved rents are unavailable, Radix reflects the average market rent (including amenities) for all units within the unit type.
