A property's leased percentage is a common metric used to evaluate how occupied, or full, a property is going to be. This article not only defines what a leased percentage is but offers practical tips for using this metric in tandem with additional, real-time data Radix offers.Â 

Definition Why it Matters

Leased percentage measures how full a property is scheduled to be by taking into consideration how many units are currently occupied, and how many units have signed leases but have not yet moved in. This metric is expressed as a ratio and looks at the number of occupied and rented units, divided by the total number of units at a property.

Monthly rental income provided by residents occupying a rental unit is the number one source of revenue for a multifamily property. As such, a leased percentage can be paired with additional performance metrics to help stakeholders monitor how full a property is on pace to be. Leased percentage is commonly used in scenarios such as lease-ups, where a property has a large number of units to rent.

### Calculating Leased Percentage (%)

A property's leased percentage is expressed as a ratio and is calculated by adding the number of occupied and leased units, divided by the total number of units at a property. **[(# Occupied Units + # Leased Units)/ Total # of Units at Property]**

### Evaluating Leased Percentage (%)

A property's leased percentage alone isn't an accurate depiction of how full a property will be. It's essential to use Available to Rent (ATR) data for a truer representation of what lies ahead. Radix offers real-time data on properties' 60-day ATR you can leverage for a better understanding of whether newly achieved leases truly stand to boost occupancy.

* **Low Leased % and High ATR:** Low leased percentages can be common for newly developed properties that are leasing up, and properties with newly renovated units to re-occupy. Dive deeper into the types of floor plans that will be available to rent with built-in tools like [Trends](https://help.radix.com/hc/en-us/articles/9060097289101) and your [Floor Plan Comparison Report.](https://help.radix.com/hc/en-us/articles/15100961400845) These can be used to compare your floor plan availability to your comps and gain the context needed to strategically price, market, and present your available units to prospects.
* **High Leased % and High ATR:**Although a property's high leased percentage may look promising for occupancy, high ATR indicates there is still leasing work to be done. The same tools outlined above can be used to determine the best way to decrease ATR and achieve true occupancy gains.
