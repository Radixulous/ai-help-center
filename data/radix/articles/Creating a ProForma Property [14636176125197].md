Creating a ProForma property allows you to build a custom property so you can evaluate whether it supports your investment objectives. Once you've built a custom property, you'll be able to test its' rents against selected competitors using their live market survey data.

To create a ProForma property you can either:

* **Clone an existing property:** This option is recommended for those looking to underwrite an existing asset.
* **Build a new property:** This option is recommended for those looking to underwrite a new development opportunity that doesn't physically exist.

Regardless of the option you choose, the ProForma property you create is private and only visible to those you decide to share it with.

#### **Cloning an Existing Property**

To clone a property that already exists in the system:

Step 1:

Click the *Add Custom Property* button located on the left side of your ProForma dashboard.

Step 2:

A new window will appear where you can search for an existing property to clone by name or by address.

Step 3:

Once you've located the property you want to clone, select it and rename the property. Then click *Yes, I Am Sure* to finish cloning the property.

Step 4:

Your cloned ProForma property will automatically display on your ProForma dashboard for you to start working with. A "Custom Property" banner will display across the property image, as a reminder that this is a custom property. You can always access your created ProForma property from the menu on the left side of your screen.

#### **Building a New Property**

If the property you're looking to underwrite doesn't yet physically exist, you'll need to build a new ProForma property.

To build a new ProForma property in the system:

Step 1:

Click *Add Custom Property* button located on the left side of your ProForma dashboard.

Step 3:

You'll be prompted to add the following information needed for your custom ProForma property.

* + **Property Info:** Crucial information such as the property's name, construction type, and location will be added here.
  + **Floor Plans:** The property's floor plans can be bulk uploaded or individually added here.
  + **Amenities:** You can choose from a variety of community and location amenity options or create your own custom amenities here.
  + **Fees/Deposits:** Common refundable and non-refundable fees can be added for your property here.

**Note:** You can create a ProForma property without all of this information added. However, the more information you include, the more you'll be able to compare that information against the competitor properties you add to your ProForma property.

Step 4:

Once you've entered in your ProForma property's details, click Add Property to save your changes and create your custom ProForma property.

Step 5:

Your newly created ProForma property will automatically display on your ProForma dashboard for you to start working with. A "Custom Property" banner will display across the property image, as a reminder that this is a custom property. You can always access your created ProForma property from the menu on the left side of your screen.
