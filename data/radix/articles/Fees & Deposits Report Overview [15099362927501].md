The Fees & Deposits Report allows you to easily review all fees, deposits, and lease terms being offered at a property. When you need a visual rundown of what's being offered at a property in comparison to its' competitors, this report is your solution!

Use this report to help answer questions such as:

+ How do the fees offered at a property stack up to fees offered by competitors?
+ Is there an opportunity to increase/decrease the fees and/or deposits being offered by a property?
+ What competitive advantages/disadvantages does a property have when it comes to fees and deposits?

### Accessing the Report

**Pro Tip:**

If you're responsible for leasing at your property, take note of the competitive advantages your property has from this report! Even if you're not offering specials, be sure to mention the cost savings your property offers a prospective resident up-front, and throughout their lease term.

For example, using the scenario above, we can see that Marcus Aurelius Place has significantly lower fees and deposits than Augustus Apartments. When considering the cost difference between their administrative, application, pet deposit, and security deposit fees, Marcus Aurelius Place can save a prospect $756 dollars on their moving costs. That's a figure worth mentioning!
