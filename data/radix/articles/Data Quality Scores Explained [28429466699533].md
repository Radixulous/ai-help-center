Within RealRents, every up-to-date property survey receives a Data Quality Score. Data Quality Scores are provided at the end of each property survey and are accompanied by recommendations to improve the score. As you prepare to take action on survey data, this score is designed to help you understand how accurate that survey data is.

### How Data Quality Scores are Calculated

Our advanced algorithms will automatically calculate a Data Quality Score for a property survey based on three key characteristics of the data that has been entered:

1. **Missing data values:** Points are deducted from a property's overall score when data values (i.e. occupancy, leased %, leases per week, etc.) are missing.
2. **Repeated data values:** Points are deducted from a property's overall score when data values have not changed week over week. For example, if the number of apartments available to rent (ATR) has consistently not changed, points will be deducted from the property's score.
3. **Data anomalies:** Points are deducted from a property's overall score when data anomalies occur. For example, if a data value like occupancy % has increased or decreased exponentially, points will be deducted from the property's overall score.

### Increasing Data Quality Scores (DQS)

Data Quality Scores are designed to surface potential data issues and can be improved when those potential issues are resolved.

You can resolve a data issue and achieve a 100% score by:

* **Entering an updated value:** If you notice the potential data issue is due to a value mistakenly entered, enter an updated value in the space provided. Then click *Resolve*.
* **Verifying the existing value is accurate:** If you've reviewed the potential data issue and know the value to be correct, click *The entered value is correct*.

### Locating Data Quality Scores

Where can you find each property's Data Quality Score? Scores for your property and each of the competitors you have on your market survey can easily be found on the RealRents page.

* **Your Property's Score:**Your property's score is displayed on the side of property's name at the top of the Surveys page. You will only see a score when your property's survey has been updated within the past 7 days.
* **Your Competitor Scores:** Scores for each of the competitors on your market survey are displayed on the Competitor updates table in the Data Quality Score column. You will only see a score when the property's survey has been updated within the past 7 days.
