* What amenities does the property have that its' competitors don't?

### Viewing the Report

The Amenities report is broken into three main sections:

1. **Unit Amenities:** Any unique or non-essential features of an apartment such as backsplash, high-ceilings, built-in bookshelves, etc.
2. **Community Amenities:** Interior and exterior recreation spaces for residents such as pools, clubhouses, fitness centers, etc.
3. **Location Amenities:** How close the property is to certain amenities in the areas (i.e., beaches, hiking trails, retail) and transportation options (i.e., airport, freeway access).

An amenity score is provided per property at the bottom of each section so you can easily benchmark amenities.

Available amenities are noted by a checkmark so you can visually pinpoint what is and isn't offered.
