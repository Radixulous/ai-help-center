When you're benchmarking your property's performance against others, it's crucial to understand how recent the data you're analyzing is. This is why you'll often see different colored clocks throughout our Radix products. These clocks exist to help you understand how up-to-date the survey data you're using is.

### What do Colored Clocks Represent?

To ensure your decision-making is fueled with the latest data, Radix promotes weekly property survey updates. Whether a property's survey has received its weekly update is the driving factor behind the clock colors you see.

There are three (3) different clock colors you can encounter when working within Radix:

* **Green Clock:**
  Indicates the property's survey was updated within the last 7 days.
* **Orange Clock:**
  Indicates the property's survey was updated within the last 8 - 14 days.
* **Red Clock:** Indicates
  it has been 15+ days since the property's survey was updated.

### Obtaining Updated Survey Data

Your Competitors table makes it easy to spot surveys in need of an update and gives you a quick option to update the property's survey directly from the table.

A colored clock is displayed next to each of the competitors you're benchmarking your property's performance against. If you see an orange or red clock, click the three vertical dots next to the clock, then click *New Property Survey* to enter updated data for the property.
