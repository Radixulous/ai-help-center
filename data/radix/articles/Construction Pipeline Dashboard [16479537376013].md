The Construction Pipeline dashboard offers an interactive map that can be used to gain visibility on what projects exist, and what stage of the construction lifecycle they're in.

Using the interactive map you can:

* Filter projects by a specific MSA
* Filter projects by construction stage
* Search specific projects by address or name

Once a project has been located, use the dashboard to hone in on details such as product type, number of units, management company, owner, etc.
