For you to facilitate a better strategic decision Radix helps surface key insights on the leading indicators of supply and demand. Our Insights Dashboard will focus on ATR as a measurement of supply of units available and then Traffic and Leases per week as a measurement of demand for units. In the absence of the optimal ATR % with enough traffic and leases per week, to maintain an ideal ATR, use the insights dashboard to make the best data-driven decisions.

### How to access the Insights Dashboard

While on your property Dashboard, click on Insights Dashboard, next to your property name, and you will be redirected to the Insights Dashboard page.

### Insights Dashboard Tools

#### Data Quality Assurance

Initially, you'll be informed about the reliability of the data that the insights are based on. If the Data Quality Score isn't at its highest, you will be notified via an announcement. You will also see the Data Quality displayed separately for your property and your competitors. If any adjustments are needed, you'll have the option to select 'Improve Data Quality' next to the Data Quality Score, this option will redirect you to the Surveys page to make the necessary improvements.

#### Weekly Alerts

You will be alerted if any significant changes have been made to the positive or negative within the competitors' properties in NER, ATR%, Traffic/week, Lease/week and Occupancy % on the last survey. If a survey had not been conducted the previous week, alerts will not be displayed for that property. You can view All alerts at once, or view them one by one just by clicking on the metric you are interested.

#### Leading Indicators: Supply & Demand

Here you have detailed information of how the leading indicators are performing. You can analyze and compare the ATR, Traffic/week and Leases/week between the subject property and comps for a period of 30 days. First we have information for ATR % as a measurement of Supply and below we have the information for Traffic and Leases per week as measurement of Demand. If you click on the information icon, you will see the information on How we calculate leading indicators.

To see more detailed information click on "Show Insights" and you will see insights an what the ratings of each metric mean.  There are two indicators to showcase the status of the values. The arrows will indicate an upward or downward trend, reflecting whether your property or comparable properties have experienced an increase or decrease in the respective metric over the past 30 days. And ,the descriptors such as "Weak," "Fair," and "Strong" that will be displayed alongside the values depending on the data.

A brief understanding of the descriptors:

**Weak**

ATR is greater than 10 %

The number of leases signed in the last week didn’t meet requirements and is trending down over the last 30 days.

The property did not meet the requirement to achieve or maintain a strong ATR and the 30-day trend is decreasing.

**Fair**

ATR is between 6-10 %

The number of leases signed in the last week didn’t meet the requirement but has trended up over the past 30 days.

The property did not meet the requirement to achieve or maintain a Strong ATR but the 30-day trend is improving.

**Strong**

ATR is 6% or less

The number of leases signed this week is equal to or greater than what the properties or comps need to achieve or maintain Strong ATR % over the next 60 days.

Enough number of traffic last week to sign the required number of leases to achieve or maintain a strong ATR.

#### Current Performance

This section enables you to efficiently compare key metrics such as Occupancy, Net Effective Rent, and RevPAU against comparable properties, alongside a 30-day trend analysis
