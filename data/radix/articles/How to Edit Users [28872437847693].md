The roles, permissions, and levels of access you want associated with an individual can change over time. That's why we give you the tools you need to keep your team's access up to date within Radix. When you need to make an edit to a user, the tools you need are located within the Manage Users section of Radix.

### Accessing Manage Users

To navigate to the Manage Users section of Radix, click the profile icon found in the upper right-hand corner of your screen, then select *Manage Users.*

### Editing Users

On the *Manage Users* page, type the name or email of the user you want to edit in the *Search Box.* Once you find the user you intend to edit click on the three vertical dots to the right of their name. Then select  *Edit User* from the drop-down that appears.
