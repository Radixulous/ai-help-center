When you're looking to gain a deeper understanding of historical property performance, the Trends feature located on your custom property's dashboard is readily available to assist.

The Trends feature is interactive and uses published market survey data to show historical performance for metrics such as NER, Occupancy %, Concessions, Traffic, ATR, etc. Click on any of the available metrics to view historical trend lines and compare your property's performance.

Read on to learn more about how to customize the trend lines you see for your unique purposes.

### Customizing Trends

You can configure your trend lines to keep things high-level or dig into historical performance in more granular detail using the options below.

#### **Group Comps**

The default setting is to display a single trend line representative of the competitor average. Click the gear icon and toggle this option off if you want to view a trend line per competitor property.

#### **Floor Plan Options**

Certain metrics such as NER, Concessions, ATR, etc., are reported at the floor plan level. You can use the different options under the Floor Plans menu to drill down at the floor plan level.

* **Floor Plan Averages:** Select this option if you want to view a trend line representative of the competitor or property average. ![Line graph showing concession trends for various properties over time, with averages selected.](attachments/16437414391053.png)
* **All Floor Plans:** Select this option if you want to view a trend line for every single floor plan offered. ![Line graph showing concessions trends for various 2 and 3-bedroom floor plans over time.](attachments/16437493720845.png)

* **Floor Plan Types:** You can select a specific floor plan type (i.e., Studio, 1 Bedroom, etc.) to view a trend line representative of the average for that floor plan type.

#### **Date Range**

Use the date range menu to adjust trends to span a longer or shorter period of time. The date range selected here will also update the data values within the Competitors and Snapshot areas of your property dashboard.

#### **Perspectives**

The *Perspectives* feature allows you to exclude specific floor plans, unit types, and properties from your analysis. For example, if you want to see how your custom property ranks when factoring in renovated units only, applying a perspective would allow you to do so.

* To apply a perspective, select one you've already created from the Perspectives menu. For detailed instructions on how to create a perspective, you can learn more [here](https://help.radix.com/hc/en-us/articles/7313516628749).
