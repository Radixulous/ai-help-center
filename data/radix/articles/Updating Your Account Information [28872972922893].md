* **First and Last Name:** Edit your first and last name with these fields.
* **Email address:** Update the email address associated with your account. Domains commonly associated with personal email addresses such as Gmail and Yahoo will not be accepted.
* **Sub-role:** Choose the best sub-role that aligns with your current job here. Doing so helps other Radix users within your organization's account understand why you have the level of access you do.

#### Updating Your Password

You can change your password in this section by entering your current password, and your new desired password. Once you have updated your password click *Save*. A message will be displayed letting you know your password has been successfully updated.
