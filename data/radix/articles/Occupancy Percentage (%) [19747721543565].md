In the multifamily real estate realm, occupancy is a fundamental metric for all invested in the success of a property to monitor. This article not only defines what occupancy is but also offers practical tips for leveraging your Radix occupancy data.

Definition Why it Matters

Occupancy percentage (often referred to simply as occupancy) is a measure of how full a property is. As a metric, occupancy looks at the ratio of occupied units to the total number of units at a property, expressed as a percentage.

Monthly rental income provided by residents occupying a rental unit is the number one source of revenue for a multifamily property. As such, occupancy is directly linked to a property's revenue potential, making it a vital indicator for property stakeholders to monitor closely.

#### Calculating Occupancy Percentage (%)

Occupancy percentage is the ratio of occupied units within a property to the total number of units the property is comprised of. **(# Occupied Units/ Total # of Units)**

#### Evaluating Your Occupancy Data

At Radix, we offer our users real-time data on additional metrics such as ATR, Rent, Traffic, and Leases per Week to help you gain a comprehensive understanding of how your property's occupancy performance can be optimized.

Here are examples of how these metrics can be used to evaluate whether your property is on par with your strategic occupancy goals:

* **High Occupancy and Low ATR:** Consistently high occupancy paired with consistently low ATR can be a positive sign of strong demand for your property's units. This may indicate an opportunity to push rents with current and prospective renters.
* **Low Occupancy and High ATR:** On the flip side, consistently low occupancy paired with consistently high ATR can signal multiple flags for stakeholders to assess. Is enough traffic being driven to the property? Are teams effectively closing on traffic to secure leases? Are asking rents achievable? Leverage your Radix data and explore metrics such as closing ratios, rents, traffic, and leases per week to paint a picture of property performance and game plan for how to mitigate exposure.
* **Monitoring RevPau:** While a consistently high occupancy rate is typically associated with a steady revenue stream, occupancy alone won't paint a full picture of how a property's rental revenue can be optimized. Gains in occupancy are often a balancing act with gains in asking rents. We recommend monitoring Revenue Per Available Unit (RevPau) to better understand whether that balancing act is working in your favor.
