Are you dealing with a locked property? In this article, we'll bring you up to speed on what a locked property is and how to handle it when you've encountered one.

#### What is a Locked Property?

A locked property refers to any competitor property you have that displays a lock icon next to its name on your Competitors Table.

#### Why is a Competitor Property Locked?

To prevent other users from updating their data, a lock icon will always display for your competitor properties that *also use Benchmark.* We believe the best data is derived directly from the source, and give the property up to 14 days to update their survey before it becomes unlocked for others to update.

#### When will the Property be Unlocked?

Competitor properties that also use Benchmark will remain locked for 14 days. If 15 days have passed since the property's survey was updated, it will become unlocked for you and any other Benchmark user to update.
