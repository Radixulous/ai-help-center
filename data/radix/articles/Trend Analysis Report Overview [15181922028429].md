The Trend Analysis Report is a helpful tool for those looking to view how a property metric (i.e., closing ratio, occupancy %, leased %, traffic, etc.) is trending over a period of time.

Interactive capabilities within the report allow you to:

+ Pull the report for a single property, or multiple properties in your portfolio.
+ Stack metrics to explore the relationship between different values.
+ View your historical data as a table or as a trend line.

### Accessing the Report

To access the report, click the *Reports* tab in the top menu bar, then select *Trend Analysis* from the report options.

### Customizing the Report

Use the following drop-down menus to tailor the report to your needs:

* **Properties:** Add a single property or multiple properties from within your portfolio here. You can search by property name, or add one from the list provided.
* **Perspectives:** Applying a perspective allows you to further customize the property information in your analysis. For example, maybe you only want to exclude a floor plan type like townhomes from your report. Using a perspective would allow you to do this. For more information on how to create a perspective, check out [How to Use Perspectives.](https://help.radix.com/hc/en-us/articles/7313516628749)
* **Date Range:** Choose from one of the date ranges provided here.
* **Preferences:** 
  + Metrics: Select the data points you want to view trends for here. A trend table will populate for each metric you opt to include.
  + Floor Plans: Do you want to view one trend line for each floor plan type? An average trend line that encompasses all floor plan types? Or an average trend line that encompasses one floor plan type? Choose the option you prefer here.
  + Group Subject Properties: If you've included multiple properties in your report, toggling this option on will group them all together into one trend line. Prefer a trend line per property? Leave this option toggled off.
  + Table View: The default report view showcases data as trend charts. Toggle this option on if you want to view data as a table instead.
  + Show Comps Averages: It's often helpful to include a trend line of the comp average to benchmark your property's performance against. If you don't want to include this trend line, toggle this option off.

Click *Run Report* after you've made your selections.

### Viewing the Report

A trend chart will appear for each metric you included in the Preferences menu.

The date range you chose will be outlined along the X-axis of each chart, with the metric's relevant unit of measurement outlined on the Y-axis.

The image above shows one example of how stacking trend tables can help guide your analysis of the relationships between different metrics.

In this example, we've used Traffic/Week and Concessions to help evaluate whether offering concessions may be related to a property's change in week over week traffic.
