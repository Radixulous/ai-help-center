Keeping your Property Survey updated ensures it remains visible on [RealRents](https://help.radix.com/hc/en-us/articles/32826267937933-RealRents), while also enabling you to track performance and make informed decisions based on real-time data. This article provides a guide on how to update your property's survey, which requires a weekly refresh.

### Updating property surveys

Select *Surveys* from the Benchmark dropdown menu found at the top of your screen.

To ensure your property is listed on RealRents, make sure your survey is kept up to date. Even if PMS integration is in place, it’s important to review and confirm concessions weekly.
