When it comes to benchmarking your property's performance, ensuring your property is being compared to the most relevant competition is critical. You can think of our **CompMatch** feature as your built-in assistant; it continually scopes out the potential competition, surfaces properties you may want to add as a comp, and helps you feel confident you have your eyes on the properties that matter.

### Overview

Not all properties are created equal, and our CompMatch feature uses an advanced algorithm to generate recommendations based on how similar a property is to yours. The following characteristics are used by the algorithm to analyze properties and generate a similarity score for you:

* Construction Type
* Net Effective Rent (NER)
* Number of Units
* Proximity
* Square Footage
* Unit Mix
* Walk Score/Bike Score
* Year Built

Use this similarity score to decide whether you'd like to accept or ignore the recommendation. When interacting with this feature, you'll find recommendations broken into three general categories:

1. **Recommended Comps:** Displays any new recommendations pending your review. You can either accept or ignore the recommendation.
2. **Considering You as a Comp:** Outlines recommended properties that consider your property to be a comp, but have not been added to your comp set yet.
3. **Ignored Comps:** Shows previous recommendations that were ignored. Clicking the (+) icon to the left of the property's name will give you the ability to see why the property was ignored.

Locating Your Recommended Comps Reviewing Your Recommended Comps

Our algorithm continually analyzes properties and outputs any recommendations it has every 24 hours. To locate the comps recommended for your property, navigate to the **Manage Comps** window.

* Click the profile icon found in the upper right-hand corner of your screen, and select *Manage Properties* from the menu that appears.

#### Ignoring Recommended Comps

* To ignore the recommendation, click *Ignore.*
* You'll be prompted to enter a reason for ignoring the comp and it will be added to the Ignored Comps section of the window. You, and anyone else with access to the property, can click the **(+)** icon to review why the property was ignored. ![List of ignored comps with options to accept or ignore; includes similarity scores.](attachments/20541039231501.png)

  + Click *Accept -*Once accepted, you can use the interactive map to review the accepted comps' proximity to your property and any existing comps you already have.
