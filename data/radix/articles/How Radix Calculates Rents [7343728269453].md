Radix collects the **best available rental rate for a 12-month** lease term directly from properties via weekly survey updates. Rents are then displayed by unit type throughout our platform for you to leverage.

#### Integrated Properties

For properties that have an established Property Management System (PMS) integration, rents are calculated using the following methodology:

1. **Asking Rents:** When units are available, Radix reflects the average asking rent (including amenities) of all units within the unit type that are becoming available in the next 60 days.
2. **Achieved Rents:** If no units are available, Radix reflects the average achieved rent (including amenities) for all units within the unit type that have been leased in the last 30 days, and move-ins scheduled for the next 60 days.
3. **Market Rents:** If achieved rents are unavailable, Radix reflects the average market rent (including amenities) for all units within the unit type.

**Note:** Model, admin, and down units are not included in rent calculations for integrated properties unless the third Market Rent methodology is being used.

Use the ***PMS Import*** function on your property survey for detailed information on which of these methods are being used to calculate rents for different floor plans at your property. [Click here](https://help.radix.com/hc/en-us/articles/27994992281869-Updating-Your-Integrated-Property-Survey) to learn more about this function.

**A Note on Revenue Management Systems:** Revenue management pricing platforms (i.e., Yieldstar, LRO, etc.) that are integrated with your PMS are incorporated into our integration feature to reflect information coming directly from your revenue management provider.Â 

Unless concessions are explicitly offered in your revenue management software, our integration will not capture concessions. Concessions being offered outside of the revenue management software must be entered via our Concessions Calculator at the time of the survey update.

#### Non-Integrated Properties

For properties that do not have a PMS integration, users should enter the best available rate for a 12-month lease. This allows for more accurate benchmarking with other properties within our platform.
