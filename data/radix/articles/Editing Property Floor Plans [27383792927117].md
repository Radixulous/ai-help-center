There may be times when you need to update the floor plans associated with a property in Benchmark. Within Benchmark, you can update your property's floor plans at any time. You can also update the floor plans for competitors on your market survey who are *not* Benchmark customers.

**A note for integrated properties:** When your property has an established integration, floor plans are imported from your property management system (PMS). Any floor plan changes you want to see in Benchmark must be made in your PMS for our system to reflect them.

### How to Edit Floor Plans

Within Benchmark you can update floor plans for your property, and for competitors on your market survey that are not Benchmark customers. Follow the steps below to do so.

* **Step 1:** Click on the profile icon located in the upper right-hand corner of your screen. Then, select *Manage Properties* from the menu that appears.
