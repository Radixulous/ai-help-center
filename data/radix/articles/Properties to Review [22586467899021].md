Properties to Review is a Benchmark feature incorporated into your [Portfolio Snapshot](https://help.radix.com/hc/en-us/articles/7311719344781). Properties to Review is designed to help you pinpoint properties within your portfolio that are trailing their competitors for a selected metric (i.e., Occupancy %, Traffic per Week, NER, etc.).

### Leveraging Properties to Review

* Click any metric on your interactive Portfolio Snapshot table, and Properties to Review will automatically show you the three (3) properties in your portfolio that are trailing their competitors the most for that selected metric.
* The property's exact ranking within its comp set is displayed in the Rank column to the right of the property's name.
* For a full list of your properties and how they rank, you can use our [Property Ranking Report](https://help.radix.com/hc/en-us/articles/18300039293581). Clicking *Review Properties* will automatically take you to this report.

**Pro Tip:**Â You can click any property shown in the Properties to Review section. This will take you to the property's Benchmark page which contains a variety of built-in data analysis tools to help you dig into why the property is trailing their competitors.

### Customizing Metric Options

You can add additional metrics to your Portfolio Snapshot. Simply click the gear icon located above Properties to Review, select the metrics you want to include, and then click *Update* to save your changes.
