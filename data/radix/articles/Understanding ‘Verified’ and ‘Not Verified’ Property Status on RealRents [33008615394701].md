RealRents provides renters with clear, accurate, and up-to-date property data — including rent prices, availability, fees, and concessions. A key part of ensuring this data stays transparent and reliable is your property’s **verification status**, which is based on how recently its information has been updated.  
  
Properties are now labeled as either **"Verified"** or **"Not Verified"**, depending on whether updates to your concessions have been made within the last 7 days and you have confirmed your fees and deposits in the last 90 days.

### Why This Matters?

Keeping your property’s information up to date isn’t just about visibility — it’s about trust. As transparency becomes a growing expectation across the rental industry, renters rely on RealRents to provide accurate and timely data.

By updating your listings weekly, you help your property meet transparency benchmarks, support compliance with renter protection regulations, and show potential renters that your listing is active, competitive, and reliable.

### Verified

A property is **Verified** when concessions have been updated within the last 7 days, and fees and deposits have been confirmed in the last 90 days. This ensures renters are seeing current pricing, fees and deposits, availability, and concessions — helping them make confident decisions.

Verified listings appear prominently on RealRents and are prioritized in search results.

### Not Verified

A property is marked as **Not Verified** if it hasn't been updated in more than 7 days. While it **still appears on RealRents**, it includes a “Not Verified” label that alerts renters that the information may be outdated.  
This label can reduce engagement and renter confidence — especially when pricing and availability are critical to decision-making.  
You can check your property’s verification status at the top-right of your Radix Property Dashboard as well as your RealRents property listing.

### Best Practices

To maintain transparency and ensure your property appears as Verified:

* Confirm or edit concessions for each property every 7 days.
* Confirm fees and deposits every 90 days.

Keeping your listings current helps your property stand out — and reinforces RealRents’ commitment to data transparency.
