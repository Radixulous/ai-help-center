Are you looking for an existing property to underwrite, but can't find it? Do you need to add a competitor to your ProForma property, but can't locate them in our system?

If you cannot locate a property in our system, our team would be happy to add it for you.

To request a property addition you'll simply need to:

1. **Complete the New Property Import Template:** We love details, and the more information you can provide about your property on this form the merrier. This will save you time entering details once the property has been added. Providing detailed information will also allow you to compare more fields such as fees, construction type, and year built when performing your property analysis.
2. **Email our Support Team:** Once you've completed the New Property Import Template, email the form to [support@radix.com](mailto:support@radix.com) to submit your request.

Our team will take it from there and let you know when your requested property addition is ready to go.

#### Prefer to add the property yourself?

You can find detailed information on how to build a new property in our [Creating a ProForma Property](https://help.radix.com/hc/en-us/articles/14636176125197) article.
