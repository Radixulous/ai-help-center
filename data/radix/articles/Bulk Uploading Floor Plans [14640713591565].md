While you can add floor plans to your ProForma property individually, you also have the option to upload multiple floor plans at once. This may be a more efficient option in scenarios where you have a large quantity of floor plans to add, or when you have multiple versions of the same floor plan to add.

#### Bulk Uploading Your Floor Plans

To bulk upload your floor plans, follow the steps outlined below.

**Step 1:**

Locate the property you want to upload floor plans for.

* Each of your ProForma properties can be accessed from the banner on the left side of your ProForma dashboard.
* Search for a ProForma property by name, or select it from the displayed list of options.

**Step 2:**

Once you've located your ProForma property, click the pencil icon located to the right of the property's name.

**Step 4:**

The Excel document will auto-download to your computer once it's been clicked.

* Use this document to provide the following information, per floorplan.
  + Number of Bedrooms
  + Number of Bathrooms
  + Floor Plan Description
  + Unit Count
  + Square Footage
