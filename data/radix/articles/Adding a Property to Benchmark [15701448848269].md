Do you need a property added to Benchmark? Current Benchmark users can contact our team at any time to request property additions. Our team handles requests to add subject properties as well as requests to add competitor properties.

### **Requesting a Subject Property Addition**

A subject property is a property you manage. Common scenarios where you may need to request to have a subject property added to Benchmark are:

* **New Development:** You're ready to start using Benchmark for your new lease-up property.
* **New Acquisitions:** You're ready to start using Benchmark for a property you've recently acquired management or ownership of.
* **New Portfolio:** Your organization uses Benchmark and properties in your portfolio are going to start using it too.

To request a subject property addition, email [onboarding@radix.com](mailto:onboarding@radix.com) the following items:

+ Property & User Data Form: This form is used to provide crucial information such as the property's name, address, unit count, etc. You'll also use this form to provide billing information for the property.
+ Market Survey: Include the latest market survey for the property. The market survey should include all floor plan types with their respective unit mixes, square footage, and base rents.
+ Unit Mix Report: A Box Score Summary, Unit Statistics Report, or Market Rent Schedule should be extracted directly from your property management system and provided.

### **Requesting a Competitor Property Addition**

A Competitor Property is a comparable property you want to benchmark your property against. If you cannot find the property in our system, email [support@radix.com](mailto:support@radix.com) the items below and our team will create it for you.

+ New Property Import Template: We love details, and the more information you can provide about the competitor the merrier. This will save you time entering details once the property has been added. Providing detailed information will also allow you to compare more fields such as fees, construction type, and year built when performing your property analysis.
