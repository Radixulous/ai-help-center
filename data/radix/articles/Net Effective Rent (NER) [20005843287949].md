Net Effective Rents (NER) provide those invested in the success of a property with a metric that can be used to assess a property's revenue potential. By factoring in the impact of concessions, NER offers a more accurate depiction of revenue potential than rents alone can provide. In this article, we'll unpack what NER is, how Radix calculates NER, and outline key features to help evaluate NER.

Definition Why it Matters

Net Effective Rent (NER) is a unit's monthly rent amount after monetary concessions have been discounted. While NER typically reflects achieved rents, Radix focuses on **asking rents** to help users focus on how to maximize the revenue potential of *available units*. In this way, NER is calculated by deducting concessions from a unit's monthly asking rent.

An accurate portrayal of how much rental income a property will achieve is essential for accurate financial planning. Net Effective Rent (NER) offers a truer reflection of rental income because concessions have been factored into the equation. By continually evaluating how a property's net effective asking rents compare to competitors, you can also gain a truer reflection of where your performance expectations should lie.

### Calculating Net Effective Rent (NER)

Radix calculates NER with **asking rents** to help users focus on optimizing the revenue potential of a property's *available units*. This is done by deducting the value of one-time or recurring concessions from the monthly asking rent. **(Monthly Asking Rent - Concessions)**

**Note:** NER is weighted based on the number of units in each floor plan.

### Evaluating Net Effective Rent (NER)

One of the goals of evaluating NER is to determine if there are opportunities to optimize a property's revenue performance. Radix offers a variety of tools to help you spot opportunities to optimize NER.

* **Benchmarking Performance:** Your [Snapshot](https://help.radix.com/hc/en-us/articles/9060091043981) and [Trends](https://help.radix.com/hc/en-us/articles/9060097289101) tools are designedÂ to help you compare your property's performance to its competition. In addition to comparing concessions and rent performance, compare supply and demand metrics such as ATR, traffic, and leases per week to help build a case for decreasing concessions, increasing asking rents, and ultimately, optimizing NER.
* **Comparing Floor Plans & Unit Types:** Your [Floor Plan Comparison Report](https://help.radix.com/hc/en-us/articles/15100961400845) is a great tool to help you answer questions relevant to optimizing NER performance. Investigate concessions, rent, and ATR for certain floor plans or unit types to answer questions such as: ***How many units of a particular floor plan are available to rent?*** and ***What concessions are being offered for specific floor plans and unit types?***
* **Scatterplot Analysis:** The Scatter Plot chart within your [Market Survey Summary Report](https://help.radix.com/hc/en-us/articles/15109001351053) helps you analyze NER performance opportunities at the floor plan level. The floor plan types offered by a property and its comps are plotted out, with a trend line for your property and a trend line representing a comp average. Use this chart to help visualize NER deltas between similar-sized floor plans.![Scatter plot showing NER vs. SQFT for various apartments with trend lines.](attachments/20037058141709.png)
