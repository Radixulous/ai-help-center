When using Benchmark's Portfolio View, by default, you'll find data displayed for all the properties linked to your portfolio. To facilitate accurate and detailed decision-making occasionally it's essential to access specific data for individual properties, MSAs, etc.. In such cases, utilizing the filtering option becomes crucial to concentrate on the desired data.

### Customize your Portfolio Benchmark

This feature allows customization based on specific criteria like a particular MSA, newly constructed properties, or distinct building types, to enable you to establish a decision-making process grounded in highly specific and informative data.

### Set the parameters

Whether you require data for properties built within a specific timeframe or wish to delve into information regarding a particular Submarket or assess the performance of a specific construction type of building, you can accomplish this by utilizing the parameters below:

* MSA/Submarket
* Construction type
* Properties
* Property status
* Same-store

> The Users Filter is applicable only for Corporate Managers.

After customizing the filter window, click the "Filter Preview" button to view which properties appear as a result of your filtering.Â  You can apply the Filter by clicking "Apply".

### Save the Filter

**Pro Tip:** After configuring your preferences save the filter for future use, and avoid the need to repeat the steps each time.

**Pro Tip:**You can edit or delete a Filter, by clicking on its name on the top left once the filter has been applied.
