| ***RealRents v2.2.1 includes an update to how concessions are managed.***  *If your organization is using this new version, please check the [Concessions](https://help.radix.com/hc/en-us/articles/35864265870349-How-to-Update-Concessions-in-RealRents)* *article in the **RealRents Help Center**for updated instructions and guidance.* |

When you need to add concessions for a property, our built-in concessions calculator will automatically calculate the value of the concession for you.

### Using the concessions calculator

The concessions calculator will become available for use once you've navigated to step 4 of the property's survey. In this step, there are two options available to activate the concessions calculator and add concessions.

* **Add bulk concessions:** When you're offering the same concession for multiple floor plans, use this option to calculate the value of the concessions for each of those floor plans at the same time.
* **Add concessions:**When you're offering a concession unique to a single floor plan, use this option to calculate the value of the concession for that particular floor plan.

#### Adding bulk concessions

* Click *Add bulk concessions* to add the same concession to multiple floor plans at once.
* A new window will appear. Use the checkboxes to select the floor plans the concession applies to. Then, use the options shown to enter the concession type, frequency, and minimum lease term a prospect must sign to be eligible for the concession.
* After you click *Apply*, you'll see the value of the concession has been automatically calculated for you!

#### Adding individual concessions

* Click *Add concessions* to add a concession to an individual floor plan.
* A small box will appear. Use the options shown to enter the concession type, frequency, and minimum lease term a prospect must sign to be eligible for the concession.
* After you click *Save*, you'll see the value of the concession has been automatically calculated for you!

To ensure your property is listed on RealRents, make sure your survey is kept up to date. Even if PMS integration is in place, it’s important to review and confirm concessions weekly.

### Concession FAQs

**How do I enter Look and Lease specials?**

Look and lease specials are offered to expedite the decision-making process and entice prospects to lease within a quicker timeframe. If the look and lease special is a waived fee or deposit, gift card, or other merchandise, notate these in the **Notes** section of the property's survey. If the look and lease special is a one-time or monthly recurring discount to rent, use the Concessions Calculator to enter the special.

**Where should I enter waived fees and deposits?**

Waived fees and deposits are often offered as specials. Since these types of specials don't impact the monthly rent amount, they should be mentioned in the **Notes** section of the property's survey.

**How do I enter different concessions for vacant units?**

If different concessions are offered for different units within the same unit type, calculate the average of the concessions. Then enter the concessions average into the Concessions Calculator. For example, if a property is offering 6 weeks free on their vacant A1 units, and 4 weeks free for the on-notice A1 units, enter 5 weeks free in the Concessions Calculator for the A1 units.
