The Data Quality Score is crucial as it ensures the accuracy, completeness, and reliability of your data. High data quality leads to better decision-making, enhances operational efficiency, and maintains compliance with industry standards. By identifying and addressing issues early, the Data Quality Score helps safeguard the integrity of your data, ultimately supporting the success and credibility of your organization. The Data Quality Score will be available in two key areas:

**Survey Quality Score:**

The Survey Quality Score provides feedback during the survey process. In the fifth step, of conducting the survey you will be notified if any data requires review before submission. Data points requiring review will be clearly identified and listed under "Potential Data Issues". Additionally, a total percentage representing the overall data quality will be displayed. Points will be deducted to highlight any issues, ensuring optimal data integrity.

You can resolve any potential data issues and achieve a 100% score by using either of the two options:

* **Enter an updated value:** If you notice the potential data issue is due to a value mistakenly entered in, enter an updated value in the space provided. Then click "Resolve".
* **Verify the value is accurate:** If after reviewing the potential data issue you know the value to be correct, click "The entered value is correct".

Once the issue is resolved, it will be removed from the list, and the overall percentage will be adjusted to reflect the points associated with the corrected issue.

**Pro Tip:** Typos and errors entered as rents will also be captured and flagged as issues. Therefore, please ensure to thoroughly review them.

**Competitors Quality Score:**

If you scroll down to the competitors' table, you will also be informed about the data quality of your competitors. The latest Survey Quality Score will be listed here to notify you of the reliability of the data.

Please note that you will not be able to correct the Data Quality Score for locked properties, as their surveys cannot be updated. However, you can ensure the highest data quality for your competitors'Â  that are not locked.
