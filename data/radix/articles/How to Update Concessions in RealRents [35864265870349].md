Keeping your concessions current is essential to maintaining visibility and lead flow on RealRents. By updating your concessions weekly, you ensure that renters always see the most accurate, appealing offers—building trust, generating better-qualified leads, and staying actively listed on the platform.

In addition to boosting performance, timely updates support compliance with growing antitrust and renter protection regulations. As fee transparency and “all-in” pricing become industry standards—driven by both renter expectations and regulatory pressures—multifamily operators are expected to clearly disclose all costs upfront. Regularly updating concessions helps meet these transparency benchmarks and positions your listings as trustworthy, competitive, and fully aligned with evolving market expectations.

RealRents automatically pulls unit-level rent data for every lease term you offer—directly from your property management system (PMS)—on a daily basis. That means the only thing you need to manage periodically and confirm, is your concessions.

This guide walks you through the simple steps of applying, editing and removing your concessions for each property.

### Why this matters?

RealRents is built on transparency. Renters visiting your listing want to understand the full value of your offering-including any specials, promotions or discounts. Properties with accurate, updated information are prioritized to the renter when they are searching for their next apartment home. Alternately listings with outdated concessions will be lower in the search hierarchy for potential renters.

## Step-by-Step: Updating Concessions

### 1. Manage Property

In the top-right corner of the page, click on **"Manage Property".**
