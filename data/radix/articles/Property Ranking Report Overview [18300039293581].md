Your Property Ranking Report helps you dig into how a property ranks against its comps across a variety of metrics. When you've strategically positioned a property to sit a certain way within its comp set, this report is the perfect companion when you're seeking to understand whether a property ranks according to the strategy you've set for it.

Pull the report for a single property, or for multiple properties in your portfolio, and answer questions such as:

* Where does your property rank on critical metrics like ATR, Concessions, NER, Occupancy, etc.?
* How has your property's rank on critical metrics changed over different date ranges?
* Has your property's rank increased or decreased across different date ranges?

#### Accessing the Report

To access the report, click the *Reports* tab in the top menu bar, then select *Property Ranking*from the report options.
