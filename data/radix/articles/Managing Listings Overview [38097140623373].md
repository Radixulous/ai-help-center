Keeping your property listing updated on RealRents is essential for maintaining a Verified status, attracting more qualified leads, and building renter trust. Within the RealRents platform, it’s now easier than ever to manage your listing details — all in one place.

This article gives a quick overview of how to update your listing and explains why it matters for your visibility, credibility, and compliance.

**Why Updating Matters**

RealRents is built on **transparency** — making it easy for renters to see true rent prices, availability, fees, deposits, and concessions you're offering. Listings that are **regularly updated** appear with a **Verified** label, giving renters confidence that your property is active, accurate, and ready for leasing.

If your listing becomes outdated, it will be marked as Not Verified, which may reduce its visibility and engagement in search results, causing the property to rank lower in search results. Regular updates help you:

* Stay **active and competitive**
* Build **trust** with renters
* Comply with emerging **renter protection and pricing transparency standards**

**Listing Details Overview**

The **Listing Details** page in RealRents provides a snapshot of how your property appears to prospective renters. It includes leasing performance metrics, unit availability, photos, amenities, fees, and more.

A badge at the top of the page clearly indicates your property's verification status, whether it is Verified or Not Verified.

You'll also see weekly leasing performance metrics such as occupancy, leased percentage, traffic, and leases. Rent and concession data is displayed by floor plan, with visibility into available units and any active concessions. Fees and deposits are broken down into mandatory and optional categories, with a clear timestamp showing the last update.

Additional sections allow you to manage your photos, update amenities, add a property description, and view third-party scores for walkability, transit access, noise levels, and online reputation.
