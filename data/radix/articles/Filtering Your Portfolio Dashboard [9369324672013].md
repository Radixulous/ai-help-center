By default, your Portfolio Dashboard within Benchmark displays data for all of your properties. When you want more detailed insights on specific subsets of your portfolio, creating a Portfolio Filter will allow you to filter your Portfolio Dashboard and concentrate on the data you desire.

### Creating Portfolio Filters

Portfolio Filters are highly customizable and allow you to filter your portfolio dashboard by MSA, distinct building types, etc. to help you refine your dashboard in meaningful ways. To create a Portfolio Filter:

#### Step 1: Choose your parameters

Use the following following parameters to select the most relevant options for your portfolio filter:

* **MSA/Submarket:** Use this option to only include properties within a defined location.
* **Construction:** Use this option to only include properties that fit a specified construction type(s).
* **Properties:** Select the specific properties you want to include with this option.
* **Year Built:** Enter a minimum and/or maximum year built to refine your properties by age.
* **Property Status:** Select whether you want to include stabilized and/or lease-up properties on your dashboard.
* **Same Store:** Your portfolio dashboard includes percent (%) changes. Toggle this option on to only include properties with the beginning and end of your selected date range.
* **Users:** If you want to refine your portfolio dashboard to only include properties assigned to a specific team member within your portfolio, select the team member from this menu. (Please note, this option is only available if you have Corporate Manager access in our system.)

#### Step 2: Preview your filtered properties

After choosing your parameters, click the *Filter Preview* button to view which properties appear as a result of your filtering.

#### Step 3: Save your filter

Once you're satisfied with your selected parameters, click *Save Filter* to save your filter for future use.

You will be prompted to enter a name for your filter before being able to save and apply it.

### Viewing Your Portfolio Filters

After you've created and applied a filter, your Portfolio Dashboard will highlight the filters applied via small labels visible in the upper left corner. On right-side, click *Clear Filter* when you want to clear your filters and revert to viewing data for your entire portfolio again.
