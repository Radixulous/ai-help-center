Radix gives you real-time data on supply and demand metrics in order to help you optimize your property's Revenue per Available Unit (RevPau). In this article, we'll unpack what RevPau is, how it's calculated, and offer tips and tools for leveraging this crucial data.

Definition Why it Matters

Revenue per Available Unit (RevPau) is a metric that indicates how well a property is able to generate revenue from its available units. This is done by multiplying a property's net effective asking rents (NER) by its occupancy percentage.

A property's ability to drive revenue is tied to far more than occupancy alone. While occupancy is important, occupancy should always be balanced with rental rates to maximize the amount of revenue available units can contribute to the property. In this way, RevPau provides a simple yet powerful metric a property can use to benchmark revenue performance, inform pricing strategies and budgets, and ultimately, optimize a property's revenue potential.

### Calculating Revenue per Available Unit (RevPau)

Radix calculates RevPau at the property level by multiplying a property's average net effective asking rents by its occupancy percentage. **(Avg. NER \* Occupancy)**

### Evaluating Revenue per Available Unit (RevPau)

Gains in occupancy and asking rents are often a balancing act, and evaluating RevPau can help as you balance the two. It can help you determine whether you've struck a desirable balance based on market conditions. Here are several tools and tips you can leverage to make the most of your RevPau data.

* **Benchmarking Performance:** Your property's [Snapshot](https://help.radix.com/hc/en-us/articles/9060091043981) is designed to help you compare your property's performance to its competitors. Use it to compare current and historical RevPau performance. You can also use it to compare performance for metrics like ATR, concessions, traffic, and leases per week to make sense of the RevPau performance you're seeing.
* **Perspectives:** When benchmarking performance, it's important to make sure you're getting an apples-to-apples comparison. Use the [Perspectives](https://help.radix.com/hc/en-us/articles/7313516628749) feature to exclude certain floor plans or unit types from your analysis, and gain a truer comparison.
* **Comparing Floorplans & Unit Types:** One way to optimize RevPau performance is to adjust asking rents. Your [Floor Plan Comparison Report](https://help.radix.com/hc/en-us/articles/15100961400845) makes a great investigative companion when exploring rent adjustments. Use it to compare your property's floor plan and unit types across metrics like rent, NER, concessions, and ATR to inform your pricing decisions.
* **Scatterplot Analysis:** The Scatter Plot chart within your [Market Survey Summary Report](https://help.radix.com/hc/en-us/articles/15109001351053) helps you analyze NER performance opportunities at the floor plan level. Each floor plan type offered by a property and its comps is plotted out, with a trend line for your property and a trend line representing your comp average. Use this chart to help visualize NER deltas between similar-sized floor plans.
