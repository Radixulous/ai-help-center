When a property survey hasn't been updated for eight or more days, the system will automatically send you a reminder email titled 'Property Update Reminder'. Within our ecosystem, every property survey should be updated weekly, and these emails are designed to help you maintain that schedule.

**Note:** Note: If a property survey has not been updated in 8 or more days, you will receive a weekly email  **on Tuesdays**  (separate from the initial reminder) indicating how many of your properties are out of date. This email includes an  **"Update Now"**  button that, once clicked, will take you directly to the RealRents page where you can complete your property survey update.  
**To be redirected successfully, you must be signed in to your Radix account.**

### Adjusting Your Property Update Reminder Email

On your Radix Analytics profile page, go to the **Notifications** section. Here, you can disable 'Property Update Reminder' emails if you prefer not to receive them.

* Click the profile icon in the upper right-hand corner of your screen, then select *Notifications* from the menu that appears. ![Dashboard showing property rankings and a menu with "Notifications" highlighted.](attachments/38035886312333.png)
* A new window will appear. Toggle the button next to Property Update Reminders to the *off* position to turn off the system's ability to send you these emails. !["Dashboard showing property rankings and notification settings for update reminders."](attachments/38035858876429.png)
