When you need to verify how your imported property survey values have been calculated,
the ***Integration Details*** on your property survey will
offer you a detailed view. You can use this detailed view to:

* View what survey values (i.e., Occupancy %, Leased %, ATR, Rents, etc.) have
  been imported.
* View how imported survey values were calculated.

Imported values are standardized within Radix so you can use our built-in benchmarking tools to make uniform property comparisons. For details on how we calculate each data point, [click here.](https://help.radix.com/hc/en-us/articles/24303786708621)

**We're Here to Help!** If you feel there is a discrepancy with any of your imported survey values, submit a ticket to our team [here](https://help.radix.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) for assistance.

### Accessing Integration Details

You can access Integration Details for a property by navigating into its property
survey. To view the detailed information on how imported survey data has been
calculated, click the hyperlinked *Integration details* text.

This detailed view is available on steps 1 - 3 of the survey since these steps contain the data points our integration calculates using your property management system's (PMS) data.

### Viewing imported survey value calculations

After you navigate into the integration details, you'll find detailed information to help you understand how the values are being calculated. Use the options on each page to dive into details on how the data point was calculated.

When navigating the integration details on the Rent page, the **Unit Price Strategy** can help you determine which of the following strategies were used to calculate the rent value for the floor plan. Clicking *View Details* will offer more granular information on the specific units factored into the calculation.

1. **Asking Rents:** When units are available, Radix reflects the average asking rent (including amenities) of all units within the unit type that are becoming available in the next 60 days.
2. **Achieved Rents:** If no units are available, Radix reflects the average achieved rent (including amenities) for all units within the unit type that have been leased in the last 30 days, and move-ins scheduled for the next 60 days.
3. **Market Rents:** If achieved rents are unavailable, Radix reflects the average market rent (including amenities) for all units within the unit type.
