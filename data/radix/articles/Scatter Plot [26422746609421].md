Our Scatter Plot feature is a customizable graph you can add to your Market Survey Summary report to help you spot opportunities to optimize your floor plan rents.

### What is the Scatter Plot?

The Scatter Plot graph helps you explore the relationship between a floor plan's square footage and the rent the floor plan is achieving. Every floor plan for your property and each of your comps is plotted out on the graph.

By visualizing every floor plan in this way, you can compare rent values for similar-sized floor plans, identify rent deltas between similar-sized floor plans, and determine whether there's an opportunity to optimize rents.

### Adding the Scatter Plot to your Market Survey Summary Report

To view the Scatter Plot graph and share it with others, you'll need to add it to your Market Survey Summary Report.

* Within the Market Survey Summary Report, click the *Preferences* icon, then toggle the Scatter Plot option to the on position. Then click *Update* to save your changes. !["Market survey summary screen with property options and update button highlighted."](attachments/26538859941773.png)

This tab contains your customizable Scatter Plot graph. ![Scatter plot showing rent vs. square footage for Augustus Apartments over the last 90 days.](attachments/26538931659405.png)

**Pro Tip**: If you want to export the Market Survey Summary Report with the Scatter Plot included, export the report via PDF. The Scatter Plot graph is not supported within Excel files.

### Customizing Your Scatter Plot

There are several ways you can customize your Scatter Plot graph to better suit your needs.

Click the *Settings* icon on the Scatter Plot graph and choose from the following customizations:

* **Vertical Axis:** Select whether you want Rent or NER values displayed on the vertical axis of the graph.
* **Floor Plans:** Use this menu to select whether you want to have all floor plans plotted out on the graph, or whether you want to refine your analysis by floor plan type (i.e. studios, one bedrooms, etc.).
* **Show Trends Line:** Choose whether you want trend lines displayed on the graph. When displayed, you'll have a trend line representing your property and a trend line representing the average slope for each of your comps.
