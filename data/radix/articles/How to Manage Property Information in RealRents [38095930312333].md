Keeping your property information accurate ensures that renters always see the most up-to-date details for your property. In RealRents, you can easily review and update your property's core information directly from the platform.

**Accessing Property Information**

To begin, click **Property Information** from the left-hand menu of your Listing Details page. This section will open a form displaying the current information saved for your property. Be sure to **double-check that the property name is accurate**.

**Note:** If you need to update the **property’s country, street address, state, city, or ZIP code**, you’ll need to contact the RealRents support team. These fields are tied to the property name and cannot be updated unless you change the property itself.

**What You Can Update**

You can update the following fields at any time:

* Property name
* Email address
* Phone number
* Property website
* Year renovated
* Additional notes

When you’ve finished making changes, click the **Review & Publish** button in the top-right corner to save and push your updates live.
