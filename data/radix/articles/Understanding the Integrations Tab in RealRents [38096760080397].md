The **Integrations** section gives you visibility into how your leasing and performance data is pulled into RealRents.

Here’s a breakdown of what each section shows:

**Occupancy % Breakdown** – shows the total number of occupied units at your property, with detailed statuses including:

* Occupied – No Notice
* Occupied – Notice – Rented
* Occupied – Notice – Unrented   
  It also provides the overall occupancy percentage.

**Leased % Breakdown** – highlights the percentage of your property that is leased. This includes:

* Total number of leased units
* Number of vacant – leased units
* Total number occupied
* Non-revenue units
* Overall leased percentage

**Traffic and Leases**

* **Traffic/week**: Shows weekly traffic data, including Application ID, the event (like toured or applied), and the sign date.
* **Leases/week**: Shows the number of new leases for the week, along with Application ID, event details, and sign date.

These tabs give you transparency into how RealRents is pulling and displaying your performance metrics, making it easier to track trends and benchmark success.

If your property is not currently integrated, a message will be displayed on this page:
