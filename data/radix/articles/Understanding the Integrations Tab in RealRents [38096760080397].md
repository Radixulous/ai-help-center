The **Integrations** section gives you visibility into how your leasing and performance data is pulled into RealRents.

Here’s a breakdown of what each section shows:

**Occupancy % Breakdown** – shows the total number of occupied units at your property, with detailed statuses including:

* Occupied – No Notice
* Occupied – Notice – Rented
* Occupied – Notice – Unrented   
  It also provides the overall occupancy percentage.

**Leased % Breakdown** – highlights the percentage of your property that is leased. This includes:

* Total number of leased units
* Number of vacant – leased units
* Total number occupied
* Non-revenue units
* Overall leased percentage

* **Leases/week**: Shows the number of new leases for the week, along with Application ID, event details, and sign date.
